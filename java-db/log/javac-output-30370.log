[2024-11-26 19:21:40] [javac-output-30370]   not setting the location of system modules may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 19
[2024-11-26 19:21:40] [javac-output-30370]     --release 19 is recommended instead of -source 19 -target 19 because it sets the location of system modules automatically
