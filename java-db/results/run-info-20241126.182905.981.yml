    # Frequency counts for external APIs that are used with untrusted data
    Using unsanitized untrusted data in an external API can cause a variety of security issues. This query reports all external APIs that are used with untrusted data, along with how frequently the API is used, and how many unique sources of untrusted data flow to this API. This query is designed primarily to help identify which APIs may be relevant for security analysis of this application.

    An external API is defined as a method call to a method that is not defined in the source code, not overridden in the source code, and is not modeled as a taint step in the default taint library. External APIs may be from the Java standard library, third party dependencies or from internal dependencies. The query will report the method signature with a fully qualified name, along with either `[param x]`, where `x` indicates the position of the parameter receiving the untrusted data or `[qualifier]` indicating the untrusted data is used as the qualifier to the method call.


    ## Recommendation
    For each result:

    * If the result highlights a known sink, no action is required.
    * If the result highlights an unknown sink for a problem, then add modeling for the sink to the relevant query.
    * If the result represents a call to an external API which transfers taint, add the appropriate modeling, and re-run the query to determine what new results have appeared due to this additional modeling.
    Otherwise, the result is likely uninteresting. Custom versions of this query can extend the `SafeExternalAPIMethod` class to exclude known safe external APIs from future analysis.


    ## Example
    If the query were to return the API `javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse.sendError(int, java.lang.String) [param 1]` then we should first consider whether this a security relevant sink. In this case, this is writing to a HTTP response, so we should consider whether this is an XSS sink. If it is, we should confirm that it is handled by the XSS query.

    If the query were to return the API `java.lang.StringBuilder.append(java.lang.String) [param 0]`, then this should be reviewed as a possible taint step, because tainted data would flow from the 0th argument to the qualifier of the call.

    Note that both examples are correctly handled by the standard taint tracking library and XSS query.

    # Overly permissive regular expression range
    It's easy to write a regular expression range that matches a wider range of characters than you intended. For example, `/[a-zA-z]/` matches all lowercase and all uppercase letters, as you would expect, but it also matches the characters: `` [ \ ] ^ _ ` ``.

    Another common problem is failing to escape the dash character in a regular expression. An unescaped dash is interpreted as part of a range. For example, in the character class `[a-zA-Z0-9%=.,-_]` the last character range matches the 55 characters between `,` and `_` (both included), which overlaps with the range `[0-9]` and is clearly not intended by the writer.


    ## Recommendation
    Avoid any confusion about which characters are included in the range by writing unambiguous regular expressions. Always check that character ranges match only the expected characters.


    ## Example
    The following example code is intended to check whether a string is a valid 6 digit hex color.

    ```java

    import java.util.regex.Pattern
    public class Tester {
        public static boolean is_valid_hex_color(String color) {
            return Pattern.matches("#[0-9a-fA-f]{6}", color);
        }
    }

    ```
    However, the `A-f` range is overly large and matches every uppercase character. It would parse a "color" like `#XXYYZZ` as valid.

    The fix is to use an uppercase `A-F` range instead.

    ```javascript

    import java.util.regex.Pattern
    public class Tester {
        public static boolean is_valid_hex_color(String color) {
            return Pattern.matches("#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}", color);
        }
    }

    ```

    \ is read from `HttpServletRequest` and then ultimately used in a call to the\
    \ `HttpServletResponse.sendError` external API:\n\n\n```java\npublic class XSS\
    \ extends HttpServlet {\n\tprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse\

    \t\t\t\t\"The page \\\"\" + request.getParameter(\"page\") + \"\\\" was not found.\"\
    );\n\t}\n}\n\n```\nThis is an XSS sink. The XSS query should therefore be reviewed\
    \ to confirm that this sink is appropriately modeled, and if it is, to confirm\
    \ that the query reports this particular result, or that the result is a false\
    \ positive due to some existing sanitization.\n\nIn this second example, again\
    \ a request parameter is read from `HttpServletRequest`.\n\n\n```java\npublic\
    \ class SQLInjection extends HttpServlet {\n\tprotected void doGet(HttpServletRequest\
    \ request, HttpServletResponse response)\n\tthrows ServletException, IOException\
    \ {\n\n\t\tStringBuilder sqlQueryBuilder = new StringBuilder();\n\t\tsqlQueryBuilder.append(\"\

    user_id\"));\n\t\tsqlQueryBuilder.append(\"'\");\n\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n}\n\n```\n\
    If the query reported the call to `StringBuilder.append` on line 7, this would\
    \ suggest that this external API is not currently modeled as a taint step in the\
    \ taint tracking library. The next step would be to model this as a taint step,\
    \ then re-run the query to determine what additional results might be found. In\
    \ this example, it seems likely that the result of the `StringBuilder` will be\
    \ executed as an SQL query, potentially leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.\n\

    \ separators (\"/\" or \"\\\\\"), or \"..\" sequences in the input, and reject\

    \ that the user input matches one of these patterns.\n\n\n## Example\nIn this\
    \ example, a file name is read from a `java.net.Socket` and then used to access\
    \ a file and send it back over the socket. However, a malicious user could enter\
    \ a file name anywhere on the file system, such as \"/etc/passwd\" or \"../../../etc/passwd\"\
    .\n\n\n```java\npublic void sendUserFile(Socket sock, String user) {\n\tBufferedReader\
    \ filenameReader = new BufferedReader(\n\t\t\tnew InputStreamReader(sock.getInputStream(),\

    \ != null) {\n\t\tsock.getOutputStream().write(fileLine.getBytes());\n\t\tfileLine\
    \ = fileReader.readLine();\n\t}\n}\n\n```\nIf the input should only be a file\
    \ name, you can check that it doesn't contain any path separators or \"..\" sequences.\n\
    \n\n```java\npublic void sendUserFileGood(Socket sock, String user) {\n\tBufferedReader\

    # Arbitrary file access during archive extraction ("Zip Slip")
    Extracting files from a malicious zip file, or similar type of archive, is at risk of directory traversal attacks if filenames from the archive are not properly validated.

    Zip archives contain archive entries representing each file in the archive. These entries include a file path for the entry, but these file paths are not restricted and may contain unexpected special elements such as the directory traversal element (`..`). If these file paths are used to create a filesystem path, then a file operation may happen in an unexpected location. This can result in sensitive information being revealed or deleted, or an attacker being able to influence behavior by modifying unexpected files.

    For example, if a zip file contains a file entry `..\sneaky-file`, and the zip file is extracted to the directory `c:\output`, then naively combining the paths would result in an output file path of `c:\output\..\sneaky-file`, which would cause the file to be written to `c:\sneaky-file`.


    ## Recommendation
    Ensure that output paths constructed from zip archive entries are validated to prevent writing files to unexpected locations.

    The recommended way of writing an output file from a zip archive entry is to verify that the normalized full path of the output file starts with a prefix that matches the destination directory. Path normalization can be done with either `java.io.File.getCanonicalFile()` or `java.nio.file.Path.normalize()`. Prefix checking can be done with `String.startsWith(..)`, but it is better to use `java.nio.file.Path.startsWith(..)`, as the latter works on complete path segments.

    Another alternative is to validate archive entries against a whitelist of expected files.


    ## Example
    In this example, a file path taken from a zip archive item entry is combined with a destination directory. The result is used as the destination file path without verifying that the result is within the destination directory. If provided with a zip file containing an archive path like `..\sneaky-file`, then this file would be written outside the destination directory.


    ```java
    void writeZipEntry(ZipEntry entry, File destinationDir) {
        File file = new File(destinationDir, entry.getName());
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file); // BAD
        // ... write entry to fos ...
    }

    ```
    To fix this vulnerability, we need to verify that the normalized `file` still has `destinationDir` as its prefix, and throw an exception if this is not the case.


    ```java
    void writeZipEntry(ZipEntry entry, File destinationDir) {
        File file = new File(destinationDir, entry.getName());
        if (!file.toPath().normalize().startsWith(destinationDir.toPath()))
            throw new Exception("Bad zip entry");
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file); // OK
        // ... write entry to fos ...
    }

    ```

    # Partial path traversal vulnerability
    A common way to check that a user-supplied path `SUBDIR` falls inside a directory `DIR` is to use `getCanonicalPath()` to remove any path-traversal elements and then check that `DIR` is a prefix. However, if `DIR` is not slash-terminated, this can unexpectedly allow access to siblings of `DIR`.

    See also `java/partial-path-traversal-from-remote`, which is similar to this query but only flags instances with evidence of remote exploitability.


    ## Recommendation
    If the user should only access items within a certain directory `DIR`, ensure that `DIR` is slash-terminated before checking that `DIR` is a prefix of the user-provided path, `SUBDIR`. Note, Java's `getCanonicalPath()` returns a **non**-slash-terminated path string, so a slash must be added to `DIR` if that method is used.


    ## Example
    In this example, the `if` statement checks if `parent.getCanonicalPath()` is a prefix of `dir.getCanonicalPath()`. However, `parent.getCanonicalPath()` is not slash-terminated. This means that users that supply `dir` may be also allowed to access siblings of `parent` and not just children of `parent`, which is a security issue.


    ```java
    public class PartialPathTraversalBad {
        public void example(File dir, File parent) throws IOException {
            if (!dir.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalPath())) {
                throw new IOException("Path traversal attempt: " + dir.getCanonicalPath());
            }
        }
    }

    ```
    In this example, the `if` statement checks if `parent.toPath()` is a prefix of `dir.normalize()`. Because `Path#startsWith` does the correct check that `dir` is a child of `parent`, users will not be able to access siblings of `parent`, as desired.


    ```java
    import java.io.File;

    public class PartialPathTraversalGood {
        public void example(File dir, File parent) throws IOException {
            if (!dir.toPath().normalize().startsWith(parent.toPath())) {
                throw new IOException("Path traversal attempt: " + dir.getCanonicalPath());
            }
        }

    # JNDI lookup with user-controlled name
    The Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) is a Java API for a directory service that allows Java software clients to discover and look up data and resources (in the form of Java objects) via a name. If the name being used to look up the data is controlled by the user, it can point to a malicious server, which can return an arbitrary object. In the worst case, this can allow remote code execution.


    ## Recommendation
    The general recommendation is to avoid passing untrusted data to the `InitialContext.lookup ` method. If the name being used to look up the object must be provided by the user, make sure that it's not in the form of an absolute URL or that it's the URL pointing to a trusted server.


    ## Example
    In the following examples, the code accepts a name from the user, which it uses to look up an object.

    In the first example, the user provided name is used to look up an object.

    The second example validates the name before using it to look up an object.


    ```java
    import javax.naming.Context;
    import javax.naming.InitialContext;

    public void jndiLookup(HttpServletRequest request) throws NamingException {
      String name = request.getParameter("name");

      Hashtable<String, String> env = new Hashtable<String, String>();
      env.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.sun.jndi.rmi.registry.RegistryContextFactory");
      env.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "rmi://trusted-server:1099");
      InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext(env);

      // BAD: User input used in lookup
      ctx.lookup(name);

      // GOOD: The name is validated before being used in lookup
      if (isValid(name)) {
        ctx.lookup(name);
      } else {
        // Reject the request
      }
    }
    ```

    # Uncontrolled command line
    Code that passes user input directly to `Runtime.exec`, or some other library routine that executes a command, allows the user to execute malicious code.


    ## Recommendation
    If possible, use hard-coded string literals to specify the command to run or library to load. Instead of passing the user input directly to the process or library function, examine the user input and then choose among hard-coded string literals.

    If the applicable libraries or commands cannot be determined at compile time, then add code to verify that the user input string is safe before using it.


    ## Example
    The following example shows code that takes a shell script that can be changed maliciously by a user, and passes it straight to `Runtime.exec` without examining it first.


    ```java
    class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            String script = System.getenv("SCRIPTNAME");
            if (script != null) {

                Runtime.getRuntime().exec(script);
            }
        }

    Passing unvalidated user input into the environment variables of a subprocess can allow an attacker to execute malicious code.


    ## Recommendation
    If possible, use hard-coded string literals to specify the environment variable or its value. Instead of passing the user input directly to the process or library function, examine the user input and then choose among hard-coded string literals.

    If the applicable environment variables cannot be determined at compile time, then add code to verify that the user input string is safe before using it.


    ## Example
    In the following (BAD) example, the environment variable `PATH` is set to the value of the user input `path` without validation.


    ```java
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        String path = request.getParameter("path");

        Map<String, String> env = processBuilder.environment();
        // BAD: path is tainted and being added to the environment
        env.put("PATH", path);

        processBuilder.start();
    }
    ```
    In the following (BAD) example, an environment variable is set with a name that is derived from the user input `var` without validation.


    ```java
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        String attr = request.getParameter("attribute");
        String value = request.getParameter("value");

        Map<String, String> env = processBuilder.environment();
        // BAD: attr and value are tainted and being added to the environment
        env.put(attr, value);

        processBuilder.start();
    }
    ```
    In the following (GOOD) example, the user's input is validated before being used to set the environment variable.


    ```java
    String opt = request.getParameter("opt");
    String value = request.getParameter("value");

    Map<String, String> env = processBuilder.environment();

    // GOOD: opt and value are checked before being added to the environment
    if (permittedJavaOptions.contains(opt) && validOption(opt, value)) {
        env.put(opt, value);
    }
    ```
    In the following (GOOD) example, the user's input is checked and used to determine an environment variable to add.


    ```java
    Map<String, String> env = builder.environment();
    String debug = request.getParameter("debug");

    // GOOD: Checking the value and not tainting the variable added to the environment
    if (debug != null) {
        env.put("PYTHONDEBUG", "1");
    }

    ```

    # Building a command line with string concatenation
    Code that builds a command line by concatenating strings that have been entered by a user allows the user to execute malicious code.


    ## Recommendation
    Execute external commands using an array of strings rather than a single string. By using an array, many possible vulnerabilities in the formatting of the string are avoided.


    ## Example
    In the following example, `latlonCoords` contains a string that has been entered by a user but not validated by the program. This allows the user to, for example, append an ampersand (&amp;) followed by the command for a malicious program to the end of the string. The ampersand instructs Windows to execute another program. In the block marked 'BAD', `latlonCoords` is passed to `exec` as part of a concatenated string, which allows more than one command to be executed. However, in the block marked 'GOOD', `latlonCoords` is passed as part of an array, which means that `exec` treats it only as an argument.


    ```java
    class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // BAD: user input might include special characters such as ampersands
            {
                String latlonCoords = args[1];
                Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
                Process exec = rt.exec("cmd.exe /C latlon2utm.exe " + latlonCoords);
            }

            // GOOD: use an array of arguments instead of executing a string
            {
                String latlonCoords = args[1];
                Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
                Process exec = rt.exec(new String[] {
                        "c:\\path\to\latlon2utm.exe",
                        latlonCoords });
            }
        }
    }

    ```

    # Access Java object methods through JavaScript exposure
    Calling the `addJavascriptInterface` method of the `android.webkit.WebView` class allows the web pages of a WebView to access a Java object's methods via JavaScript.

    Objects exposed to JavaScript are available in all frames of the WebView.


    ## Recommendation
    If you need to expose Java objects to JavaScript, guarantee that no untrusted third-party content is loaded into the WebView.


    ## Example
    In the following (bad) example, a Java object is exposed to JavaScript.


    ```java
    import android.webkit.JavascriptInterface;
    import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteOpenHelper;

    class ExposedObject extends SQLiteOpenHelper {
        @JavascriptInterface
        public String studentEmail(String studentName) {
            // SQL injection
            String query = "SELECT email FROM students WHERE studentname = '" + studentName + "'";

            Cursor cursor = db.rawQuery(query, null);
            cursor.moveToFirst();
            String email = cursor.getString(0);

            return email;
        }
    }

    webview.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
    webview.addJavaScriptInterface(new ExposedObject(), "exposedObject");
    webview.loadData("", "text/html", null);

    String name = "Robert'; DROP TABLE students; --";
    webview.loadUrl("javascript:alert(exposedObject.studentEmail(\""+ name +"\"))");

    ```

    # Android WebView JavaScript settings
    Enabling JavaScript in an Android WebView allows the execution of JavaScript code in the context of the running application. This creates a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

    For example, if your application's WebView allows for visiting web pages that you do not trust, it is possible for an attacker to lead the user to a page which loads malicious JavaScript.

    You can enable or disable Javascript execution using the `setJavaScriptEnabled` method of the settings of a WebView.


    ## Recommendation
    JavaScript execution is disabled by default. You can explicitly disable it by calling `setJavaScriptEnabled(false)` on the settings of the WebView.

    If JavaScript is necessary, only load content from trusted servers using encrypted channels, such as HTTPS with certificate verification.


    ## Example
    In the following (bad) example, a WebView has JavaScript enabled in its settings:


    ```java
    WebSettings settings = webview.getSettings();
    settings.setJavaScriptEnabled(true);

    ```
    In the following (good) example, a WebView explicitly disallows JavaScript execution:


    ```java
    WebSettings settings = webview.getSettings();
    settings.setJavaScriptEnabled(false);

    ```

    # Query built by concatenation with a possibly-untrusted string
    Even when the components of a SQL query are not fully controlled by a user, it is a vulnerability to build the query by directly concatenating those components. Perhaps a separate vulnerability will allow the user to gain control of the component. As well, a user who cannot gain full control of an input might influence it enough to cause the SQL query to fail to run.


    ## Recommendation
    Usually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each wildcard in the query.

    In the Java Persistence Query Language, it is better to use queries with parameters than to build a complete query with string concatenation. A Java Persistence query can include a parameter placeholder for each part of the query that is expected to be filled in by a different value when run. A parameter placeholder may be indicated by a colon (:) followed by a parameter name, or by a question mark (?) followed by an integer position. When the query is later executed, a value must be supplied for each parameter in the query, using the `setParameter` method. Specifying the query using the `@NamedQuery` annotation introduces an additional level of safety: the query must be a constant string literal, preventing construction by string concatenation, and the only way to fill in values for parts of the query is by setting positional parameters.

    It is good practice to use prepared statements (in SQL) or query parameters (in the Java Persistence Query Language) for supplying parameter values to a query, whether or not any of the parameters are directly traceable to user input. Doing so avoids any need to worry about quoting and escaping.


    ## Example
    In the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.

    The first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating the result of `getCategory` with some string literals. The result of `getCategory` can include special characters, or it might be refactored later so that it may return something that contains special characters.

    The second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the result of `getCategory` are not given any special treatment.


    ```java
    {
        // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it
        String category = getCategory();
        Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
        String query1 = "SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='"
            + category + "' ORDER BY PRICE";
        ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);
    }

    {
        // GOOD: use a prepared query
        String category = getCategory();
        String query2 = "SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE";
        PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);
        statement.setString(1, category);
        ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();
    }
    ```

    # Query built from user-controlled sources
    If a database query is built using string concatenation, and the components of the concatenation include user input, a user is likely to be able to run malicious database queries. This applies to various database query languages, including SQL and the Java Persistence Query Language.


    ## Recommendation
    Usually, it is better to use a SQL prepared statement than to build a complete SQL query with string concatenation. A prepared statement can include a wildcard, written as a question mark (?), for each part of the SQL query that is expected to be filled in by a different value each time it is run.

    ## Example
    In the following example, the code runs a simple SQL query in two different ways.

    The first way involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. The environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for SQL injection attacks.

    The second way, which shows good practice, involves building a query, `query2`, with a single string literal that includes a wildcard (`?`). The wildcard is then given a value by calling `setString`. This version is immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable are not given any special treatment.


    ```java
    {
        // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it
        String category = System.getenv("ITEM_CATEGORY");
        Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
        String query1 = "SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='"
            + category + "' ORDER BY PRICE";
        ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query1);
    }

    {
        // GOOD: use a prepared query
        String category = System.getenv("ITEM_CATEGORY");
        String query2 = "SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=? ORDER BY PRICE";
        PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query2);
        statement.setString(1, category);
        ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery();
    }
    ```

    ## Example
    The following code shows several different ways to run a Java Persistence query.

    The first example involves building a query, `query1`, by concatenating an environment variable with some string literals. Just like the SQL example, the environment variable can include special characters, so this code allows for Java Persistence query injection attacks.

    The remaining examples demonstrate different methods for safely building a Java Persistence query with user-supplied values:

    1. `query2` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).
    1. `query3` uses a single string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).
    1. `namedQuery1` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute is a string literal that includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a colon (`:`) and parameter name (`category`).
    1. `namedQuery2` is defined using the `@NamedQuery` annotation, whose `query` attribute includes a placeholder for a parameter, indicated by a question mark (`?`) and position number (`1`).
    The parameter is then given a value by calling `setParameter`. These versions are immune to injection attacks, because any special characters in the environment variable or user-supplied value are not given any special treatment.


    ```java
    {
        // BAD: the category might have Java Persistence Query Language special characters in it
        String category = System.getenv("ITEM_CATEGORY");
        Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
        String query1 = "SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE '"
            + category + "' ORDER BY p.price";
        Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query1);
    }

    {
        // GOOD: use a named parameter and set its value
        String category = System.getenv("ITEM_CATEGORY");
        String query2 = "SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price"
        Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query2);
        q.setParameter("category", category);
    }

    {
        // GOOD: use a positional parameter and set its value
        String category = System.getenv("ITEM_CATEGORY");
        String query3 = "SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price"
        Query q = entityManager.createQuery(query3);
        q.setParameter(1, category);
    }

    {
        // GOOD: use a named query with a named parameter and set its value
        @NamedQuery(
                name="lookupByCategory",
                query="SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE :category ORDER BY p.price")
        private static class NQ {}
        ...
        String category = System.getenv("ITEM_CATEGORY");
        Query namedQuery1 = entityManager.createNamedQuery("lookupByCategory");
        namedQuery1.setParameter("category", category);
    }

    {
        // GOOD: use a named query with a positional parameter and set its value
        @NamedQuery(
                name="lookupByCategory",
                query="SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.category LIKE ?1 ORDER BY p.price")
        private static class NQ {}
        ...
        String category = System.getenv("ITEM_CATEGORY");
        Query namedQuery2 = entityManager.createNamedQuery("lookupByCategory");
        namedQuery2.setParameter(1, category);
    }
    ```

  queryHelp: "# LDAP query built from user-controlled sources\nIf an LDAP query is\
    \ built using string concatenation, and the components of the concatenation include\
    \ user input, a user is likely to be able to run malicious LDAP queries.\n\n\n\
    ## Recommendation\nIf user input must be included in an LDAP query, it should\
    \ be escaped to avoid a malicious user providing special characters that change\
    \ the meaning of the query. If possible build the LDAP query using framework helper\
    \ methods, for example from Spring's `LdapQueryBuilder` and `LdapNameBuilder`,\
    \ instead of string concatenation. Alternatively, escape user input using an appropriate\
    \ LDAP encoding method, for example: `encodeForLDAP` or `encodeForDN` from OWASP\
    \ ESAPI, `LdapEncoder.filterEncode` or `LdapEncoder.nameEncode` from Spring LDAP,\
    \ or `Filter.encodeValue` from UnboundID library.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following\
    \ examples, the code accepts an \"organization name\" and a \"username\" from\
    \ the user, which it uses to query LDAP.\n\nThe first example concatenates the\
    \ unvalidated and unencoded user input directly into both the DN (Distinguished\
    \ Name) and the search filter used for the LDAP query. A malicious user could\
    \ provide special characters to change the meaning of these queries, and search\
    \ for a completely different set of values. The LDAP query is executed using Java\
    \ JNDI API.\n\nThe second example uses the OWASP ESAPI library to encode the user\
    \ values before they are included in the DN and search filters. This ensures the\
    \ meaning of the query cannot be changed by a malicious user.\n\n\n```java\nimport\
    \ javax.naming.directory.DirContext;\nimport org.owasp.esapi.Encoder;\nimport\
    \ org.owasp.esapi.reference.DefaultEncoder;\n\npublic void ldapQueryBad(HttpServletRequest\
    \ request, DirContext ctx) throws NamingException {\n  String organizationName\
    \ = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"\
    username\");\n\n  // BAD: User input used in DN (Distinguished Name) without encoding\n\
    \  String dn = \"OU=People,O=\" + organizationName;\n\n  // BAD: User input used\
    \ in search filter without encoding\n  String filter = \"username=\" + userName;\n\
    \n  ctx.search(dn, filter, new SearchControls());\n}\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(HttpServletRequest\
    \ request, DirContext ctx) throws NamingException {\n  String organizationName\
    \ = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"\
    username\");\n\n  // ESAPI encoder\n  Encoder encoder = DefaultEncoder.getInstance();\n\
    \n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  String safeOrganizationName\
    \ = encoder.encodeForDN(organizationName);\n  String safeDn = \"OU=People,O=\"\
    \ + safeOrganizationName;\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used\
    \ in search filter\n  String safeUsername = encoder.encodeForLDAP(username);\n\
    \  String safeFilter = \"username=\" + safeUsername;\n  \n  ctx.search(safeDn,\
    \ safeFilter, new SearchControls());\n}\n```\nThe third example uses Spring `LdapQueryBuilder`\
    \ to build an LDAP query. In addition to simplifying the building of complex search\
    \ parameters, it also provides proper escaping of any unsafe characters in search\
    \ filters. The DN is built using `LdapNameBuilder`, which also provides proper\
    \ escaping.\n\n\n```java\nimport static org.springframework.ldap.query.LdapQueryBuilder.query;\n\
    import org.springframework.ldap.support.LdapNameBuilder;\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(@RequestParam\
    \ String organizationName, @RequestParam String username) {\n  // GOOD: Organization\
    \ name is encoded before being used in DN\n  String safeDn = LdapNameBuilder.newInstance()\n\
    \    .add(\"O\", organizationName)\n    .add(\"OU=People\")\n    .build().toString();\n\
    \n  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  LdapQuery\
    \ query = query()\n    .base(safeDn)\n    .where(\"username\").is(username);\n\
    \n  ldapTemplate.search(query, new AttributeCheckAttributesMapper());\n}\n```\n\
    The fourth example uses `UnboundID` classes, `Filter` and `DN`, to construct a\
    \ safe filter and base DN.\n\n\n```java\nimport com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.LDAPConnection;\n\
    import com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.DN;\nimport com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.RDN;\nimport\
    \ com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.Filter;\n\npublic void ldapQueryGood(HttpServletRequest\
    \ request, LDAPConnection c) {\n  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"\
    organization_name\");\n  String username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\
    \n  // GOOD: Organization name is encoded before being used in DN\n  DN safeDn\
    \ = new DN(new RDN(\"OU\", \"People\"), new RDN(\"O\", organizationName));\n\n\
    \  // GOOD: User input is encoded before being used in search filter\n  Filter\
    \ safeFilter = Filter.createEqualityFilter(\"username\", username);\n  \n  c.search(safeDn.toString(),\
    \ SearchScope.ONE, safeFilter);\n}\n```\nThe fifth example shows how to build\
    \ a safe filter and DN using the Apache LDAP API.\n\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.directory.ldap.client.api.LdapConnection;\n\
    import org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.name.Dn;\nimport org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.name.Rdn;\n\
    import org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.message.SearchRequest;\nimport org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.message.SearchRequestImpl;\n\
    import static org.apache.directory.ldap.client.api.search.FilterBuilder.equal;\n\
    \npublic void ldapQueryGood(HttpServletRequest request, LdapConnection c) {\n\
    \  String organizationName = request.getParameter(\"organization_name\");\n  String\
    \ username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\n\n  // GOOD: Organization name\
    \ is encoded before being used in DN\n  Dn safeDn = new Dn(new Rdn(\"OU\", \"\
    People\"), new Rdn(\"O\", organizationName));\n\n  // GOOD: User input is encoded\
    \ before being used in search filter\n  String safeFilter = equal(\"username\"\
    , username);\n  \n  SearchRequest searchRequest = new SearchRequestImpl();\n \
    \ searchRequest.setBase(safeDn);\n  searchRequest.setFilter(safeFilter);\n  c.search(searchRequest);\n\
    }\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [LDAP Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/LDAP_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).\n\

    # Android APK installation
    Android allows an application to install an Android Package Kit (APK) using an `Intent` with the `"application/vnd.android.package-archive"` MIME type. If the file used in the `Intent` is from a location that is not controlled by the application (for example, an SD card that is universally writable), this can result in the unintended installation of untrusted applications.


    ## Recommendation
    You should install packages using the `PackageInstaller` class.

    If you need to install from a file, you should use a `FileProvider`. Content providers can provide more specific permissions than file system permissions can.

    When your application does not require package installations, do not add the `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission in the manifest file.


    ## Example
    In the following (bad) example, the package is installed from a file which may be altered by another application:


    ```java
    import android.app.Activity;
    import android.content.Intent;
    import android.net.Uri;
    import android.os.Environment;

    import java.io.File;

    /* Get a file from external storage */
    File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "myapp.apk");
    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
    /* Set the mimetype to APK */
    intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), "application/vnd.android.package-archive");

    startActivity(intent);

    ```
    In the following (good) example, the package is installed by using a `FileProvider`:


    ```java
    import android.app.Activity;
    import android.content.Context;
    import android.content.Intent;
    import android.net.Uri;
    import androidx.core.content.FileProvider;

    import java.io.File;
    import java.io.FileOutputStream;

    String tempFilename = "temporary.apk";
    byte[] buffer = new byte[16384];

    /* Copy application asset into temporary file */
    try (InputStream is = getAssets().open(assetName);
         FileOutputStream fout = openFileOutput(tempFilename, Context.MODE_PRIVATE)) {
        int n;
        while ((n=is.read(buffer)) >= 0) {
            fout.write(buffer, 0, n);
        }
    }

    /* Expose temporary file with FileProvider */
    File toInstall = new File(this.getFilesDir(), tempFilename);
    Uri applicationUri = FileProvider.getUriForFile(this, "com.example.apkprovider", toInstall);

    /* Create Intent and set data to APK file. */
    Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_INSTALL_PACKAGE);
    intent.setData(applicationUri);
    intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);

    startActivity(intent);

    ```
    In the following (good) example, the package is installed using an instance of the `android.content.pm.PackageInstaller` class:


    ```java
    import android.content.Context;
    import android.content.Intent;
    import android.content.pm.PackageInstaller;

    private static final String PACKAGE_INSTALLED_ACTION =
        "com.example.SESSION_API_PACKAGE_INSTALLED";

    /* Create the package installer and session */
    PackageInstaller packageInstaller = getPackageManager().getPackageInstaller();
    PackageInstaller.SessionParams params =
        new PackageInstaller.SessionParams(PackageInstaller.SessionParams.MODE_FULL_INSTALL);
    int sessionId = packageInstaller.createSession(params);
    session = packageInstaller.openSession(sessionId);

    /* Load asset into session */
    try (OutputStream packageInSession = session.openWrite("package", 0, -1);
         InputStream is = getAssets().open(assetName)) {
        byte[] buffer = new byte[16384];
        int n;
        while ((n = is.read(buffer)) >= 0) {
            packageInSession.write(buffer, 0, n);
        }
    }

    /* Create status receiver */
    Intent intent = new Intent(this, InstallApkSessionApi.class);
    intent.setAction(PACKAGE_INSTALLED_ACTION);
    PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(context, 0, intent, 0);
    IntentSender statusReceiver = pendingIntent.getIntentSender();

    /* Commit the session */
    session.commit(statusReceiver);

    ```

  queryHelp: "# Groovy Language injection\nApache Groovy is a powerful, optionally\
    \ typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities.\
    \ It integrates smoothly with any Java program, and immediately delivers to your\
    \ application powerful features, including scripting capabilities, Domain-Specific\
    \ Language authoring, runtime and compile-time meta-programming and functional\
    \ programming. If a Groovy script is built using attacker-controlled data, and\
    \ then evaluated, then it may allow the attacker to achieve RCE.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
    It is generally recommended to avoid using untrusted input in a Groovy evaluation.\
    \ If this is not possible, use a sandbox solution. Developers must also take care\
    \ that Groovy compile-time metaprogramming can also lead to RCE: it is possible\
    \ to achieve RCE by compiling a Groovy script (see the article \"Abusing Meta\
    \ Programming for Unauthenticated RCE!\" linked below). Groovy's `SecureASTCustomizer`\
    \ allows securing source code by controlling what code constructs are permitted.\
    \ This is typically done when using Groovy for its scripting or domain specific\
    \ language (DSL) features. The fundamental problem is that Groovy is a dynamic\
    \ language, yet `SecureASTCustomizer` works by looking at Groovy AST statically.\
    \ This makes it very easy for an attacker to bypass many of the intended checks\
    \ (see \\[Groovy SecureASTCustomizer is harmful\\](https://kohsuke.org/2012/04/27/groovy-secureastcustomizer-is-harmful/)).\
    \ Therefore, besides `SecureASTCustomizer`, runtime checks are also necessary\
    \ before calling Groovy methods (see \\[Improved sandboxing of Groovy scripts\\\
    ](https://melix.github.io/blog/2015/03/sandboxing.html)). It is also possible\
    \ to use a block-list method, excluding unwanted classes from being loaded by\
    \ the JVM. This method is not always recommended, because block-lists can be bypassed\
    \ by unexpected values.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses untrusted\
    \ data to evaluate a Groovy script.\n\n\n```java\npublic class GroovyInjection\
    \ {\n    void injectionViaClassLoader(HttpServletRequest request) {    \n    \
    \    String script = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        final GroovyClassLoader\
    \ classLoader = new GroovyClassLoader();\n        Class groovy = classLoader.parseClass(script);\n\
    \        GroovyObject groovyObj = (GroovyObject) groovy.newInstance();\n    }\n\
    \n    void injectionViaEval(HttpServletRequest request) {\n        String script\
    \ = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        Eval.me(script);\n    }\n\n   \
    \ void injectionViaGroovyShell(HttpServletRequest request) {\n        GroovyShell\
    \ shell = new GroovyShell();\n        String script = request.getParameter(\"\
    script\");\n        shell.evaluate(script);\n    }\n\n    void injectionViaGroovyShellGroovyCodeSource(HttpServletRequest\
    \ request) {\n        GroovyShell shell = new GroovyShell();\n        String script\
    \ = request.getParameter(\"script\");\n        GroovyCodeSource gcs = new GroovyCodeSource(script,\
    \ \"test\", \"Test\");\n        shell.evaluate(gcs);\n    }\n}\n\n\n```\nThe following\
    \ example uses classloader block-list approach to exclude loading dangerous classes.\n\
    \n\n```java\npublic class SandboxGroovyClassLoader extends ClassLoader {\n   \
    \ public SandboxGroovyClassLoader(ClassLoader parent) {\n        super(parent);\n\
    \    }\n\n    /* override `loadClass` here to prevent loading sensitive classes,\
    \ such as `java.lang.Runtime`, `java.lang.ProcessBuilder`, `java.lang.System`,\
    \ etc.  */\n    /* Note we must also block `groovy.transform.ASTTest`, `groovy.lang.GrabConfig`\
    \ and `org.buildobjects.process.ProcBuilder` to prevent compile-time RCE. */\n\
    \n    static void runWithSandboxGroovyClassLoader() throws Exception {\n     \
    \   // GOOD: route all class-loading via sand-boxing classloader.\n        SandboxGroovyClassLoader\
    \ classLoader = new GroovyClassLoader(new SandboxGroovyClassLoader());\n     \
    \   \n        Class<?> scriptClass = classLoader.parseClass(untrusted.getQueryString());\n\
    \        Object scriptInstance = scriptClass.newInstance();\n        Object result\
    \ = scriptClass.getDeclaredMethod(\"bar\", new Class[]{}).invoke(scriptInstance,\
    \ new Object[]{});\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Orange Tsai: [Abusing Meta\

    \ support different types of interpolation, including [Java EL expressions](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/5.1/reference/en-US/html/chapter-message-interpolation.html#section-interpolation-with-message-expressions).\
    \ Controlling part of the message template being passed to `ConstraintValidatorContext.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate()`\
    \ argument can lead to arbitrary Java code execution. Unfortunately, it is common\
    \ that validated (and therefore, normally untrusted) bean properties flow into\
    \ the custom error message.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThere are different approaches\
    \ to remediate the issue:\n\n* Do not include validated bean properties in the\
    \ custom error message.\n* Use parameterized messages instead of string concatenation.\
    \ For example:\n```\nHibernateConstraintValidatorContext context =\n   constraintValidatorContext.unwrap(HibernateConstraintValidatorContext.class);\n\
    context.addMessageParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\ncontext.buildConstraintViolationWithTemplate(\"\
    My violation message contains a parameter {foo}\")\n   .addConstraintViolation();\n\
    ```\n* Sanitize the validated bean properties to make sure that there are no EL\
    \ expressions. An example of valid sanitization logic can be found [here](https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator/blob/master/engine/src/main/java/org/hibernate/validator/internal/engine/messageinterpolation/util/InterpolationHelper.java#L17).\n\
    * Disable the EL interpolation and only use `ParameterMessageInterpolator`:\n\
    ```\nValidator validator = Validation.byDefaultProvider()\n   .configure()\n \
    \  .messageInterpolator(new ParameterMessageInterpolator())\n   .buildValidatorFactory()\n\
    \   .getValidator();\n```\n* Replace Hibernate Validator with Apache BVal, which\
    \ in its latest version does not interpolate EL expressions by default. Note that\
    \ this replacement may not be a simple drop-in replacement.\n\n## Example\nThe\
    \ following validator could result in arbitrary Java code execution:\n\n\n```java\n\
    import javax.validation.ConstraintValidator;\nimport javax.validation.ConstraintValidatorContext;\n\

  queryHelp: "# Expression language injection (JEXL)\nJava EXpression Language (JEXL)\
    \ is a simple expression language provided by the Apache Commons JEXL library.\
    \ The syntax is close to a mix of ECMAScript and shell-script. The language allows\
    \ invocation of methods available in the JVM. If a JEXL expression is built using\
    \ attacker-controlled data, and then evaluated, then it may allow the attacker\
    \ to run arbitrary code.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is generally recommended to\
    \ avoid using untrusted input in a JEXL expression. If it is not possible, JEXL\
    \ expressions should be run in a sandbox that allows accessing only explicitly\
    \ allowed classes.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses untrusted data\
    \ to build and run a JEXL expression.\n\n\n```java\npublic void evaluate(Socket\
    \ socket) throws IOException {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n\
    \        new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()))) {\n    \n    String\
    \ input = reader.readLine();\n    JexlEngine jexl = new JexlBuilder().create();\n\
    \    JexlExpression expression = jexl.createExpression(input);\n    JexlContext\
    \ context = new MapContext();\n    expression.evaluate(context);\n  }\n}\n```\n\
    The next example shows how an untrusted JEXL expression can be run in a sandbox\
    \ that allows accessing only methods in the `java.lang.Math` class. The sandbox\
    \ is implemented using `JexlSandbox` class that is provided by Apache Commons\
    \ JEXL 3.\n\n\n```java\npublic void evaluate(Socket socket) throws IOException\
    \ {\n  try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(\n        new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream())))\
    \ {\n    \n    JexlSandbox onlyMath = new JexlSandbox(false);\n    onlyMath.white(\"\
    java.lang.Math\");\n    JexlEngine jexl = new JexlBuilder().sandbox(onlyMath).create();\n\
    \      \n    String input = reader.readLine();\n    JexlExpression expression\
    \ = jexl.createExpression(input);\n    JexlContext context = new MapContext();\n\
    \    expression.evaluate(context);\n  }\n}\n```\nThe next example shows another\
    \ way how a sandbox can be implemented. It uses a custom implementation of `JexlUberspect`\
    \ that checks if callees are instances of allowed classes.\n\n\n```java\npublic\

  queryHelp: "# Server-side template injection\nTemplate injection occurs when user\
    \ input is embedded in a template's code in an unsafe manner. An attacker can\
    \ use native template syntax to inject a malicious payload into a template, which\
    \ is then executed server-side. This permits the attacker to run arbitrary code\
    \ in the server's context.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nTo fix this, ensure that untrusted\
    \ input is not used as part of a template's code. If the application requirements\
    \ do not allow this, use a sandboxed environment where access to unsafe attributes\
    \ and methods is prohibited.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example given below, an untrusted\
    \ HTTP parameter `code` is used as a Velocity template string. This can lead to\
    \ remote code execution.\n\n\n```java\n@Controller\npublic class VelocitySSTI\
    \ {\n\n\t@GetMapping(value = \"bad\")\n\tpublic void bad(HttpServletRequest request)\
    \ {\n\t\tVelocity.init();\n\n\t\tString code = request.getParameter(\"code\");\n\
    \n\t\tVelocityContext context = new VelocityContext();\n\n\t\tcontext.put(\"name\"\
    , \"Velocity\");\n\t\tcontext.put(\"project\", \"Jakarta\");\n\n\t\tStringWriter\
    \ w = new StringWriter();\n\t\t// evaluate( Context context, Writer out, String\
    \ logTag, String instring )\n\t\tVelocity.evaluate(context, w, \"mystring\", code);\n\
    \t}\n}\n\n```\nIn the next example, the problem is avoided by using a fixed template\
    \ string `s`. Since the template's code is not attacker-controlled in this case,\
    \ this solution prevents the execution of untrusted code.\n\n\n```java\n@Controller\n\
    public class VelocitySSTI {\n\n\t@GetMapping(value = \"good\")\n\tpublic void\
    \ good(HttpServletRequest request) {\n\t\tVelocity.init();\n\t\tVelocityContext\
    \ context = new VelocityContext();\n\n\t\tcontext.put(\"name\", \"Velocity\");\n\
    \t\tcontext.put(\"project\", \"Jakarta\");\n\n\t\tString s = \"We are using $project\

    # Depending upon JCenter/Bintray as an artifact repository
    [Bintray and JCenter are shutting down on February 1st, 2022](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/). Relying upon repositories that are deprecated or scheduled to be shutdown can have unintended consequences; for example, artifacts being resolved from a different artifact server or a total failure of the CI build.

    When artifact repositories are left unmaintained for a long period of time, vulnerabilities may emerge. Theoretically, this could allow attackers to inject malicious code into the artifacts that you are resolving and infect build artifacts that are being produced. This can be used by attackers to perform a [supply chain attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack) against your project's users.


    ## Recommendation
    Always use the canonical repository for resolving your dependencies.


    ## Example
    The following example shows locations in a Maven POM file where artifact repository upload/download is configured. The use of Bintray in any of these locations is not advised.

    # Log Injection
    If unsanitized user input is written to a log entry, a malicious user may be able to forge new log entries.

    Forgery can occur if a user provides some input creating the appearance of multiple log entries. This can include unescaped new-line characters, or HTML or other markup.


    ## Recommendation
    User input should be suitably sanitized before it is logged.

    If the log entries are plain text then line breaks should be removed from user input, using for example `String replace(char oldChar, char newChar)` or similar. Care should also be taken that user input is clearly marked in log entries, and that a malicious user cannot cause confusion in other ways.

    For log entries that will be displayed in HTML, user input should be HTML encoded before being logged, to prevent forgery and other forms of HTML injection.


    ## Example
    In the first example, a username, provided by the user, is logged using `logger.warn` (from `org.slf4j.Logger`). In the first case (`/bad` endpoint), the username is logged without any sanitization. If a malicious user provides `Guest'%0AUser:'Admin` as a username parameter, the log entry will be split into two separate lines, where the first line will be `User:'Guest'` and the second one will be `User:'Admin'`.


    ```java
    package com.example.restservice;

    import org.slf4j.Logger;
    import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

    @RestController
    public class LogInjection {

        private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LogInjection.class);

        // /bad?username=Guest'%0AUser:'Admin
        @GetMapping("/bad")
        public String bad(@RequestParam(value = "username", defaultValue = "name") String username) {
            log.warn("User:'{}'", username);
            // The logging call above would result in multiple log entries as shown below:
            // User:'Guest'
            // User:'Admin'
            return username;
        }
    }


    ```
    In the second example (`/good` endpoint), `matches()` is used to ensure the user input only has alphanumeric characters. If a malicious user provides \`Guest'%0AUser:'Admin\` as a username parameter, the log entry will not be logged at all, preventing the injection.


    ```java
    package com.example.restservice;

    import org.slf4j.Logger;
    import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
    import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

    @RestController
    public class LogInjection {

        private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LogInjection.class);

        // /good?username=Guest'%0AUser:'Admin
        @GetMapping("/good")
        public String good(@RequestParam(value = "username", defaultValue = "name") String username) {
            // The regex check here, allows only alphanumeric characters to pass.
            // Hence, does not result in log injection
            if (username.matches("\\w*")) {
                log.warn("User:'{}'", username);

                return username;
            }
        }
    }

    ```

    # Using a static initialization vector for encryption
    When a cipher is used in certain modes such as CBC or GCM, it requires an initialization vector (IV). Under the same secret key, IVs should be unique and ideally unpredictable. If the same IV is used with the same secret key, then the same plaintext results in the same ciphertext. This can let an attacker learn if the same data pieces are transferred or stored, or help the attacker run a dictionary attack.


    ## Recommendation
    Use a random IV generated by `SecureRandom`.


    ## Example
    The following example initializes a cipher with a static IV, which is unsafe:


    ```java
    byte[] iv = new byte[16]; // all zeroes
    GCMParameterSpec params = new GCMParameterSpec(128, iv);
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/PKCS5PADDING");
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, params);
    ```
    The next example initializes a cipher with a random IV:


    ```java
    byte[] iv = new byte[16];
    SecureRandom random = SecureRandom.getInstanceStrong();
    random.nextBytes(iv);
    GCMParameterSpec params = new GCMParameterSpec(128, iv);
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/GCM/PKCS5PADDING");
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, params);
    ```

    # Improper validation of user-provided size used for array construction
    Using unvalidated input when specifying the size of a newly created array can result in the creation of an array with size zero. If this array is subsequently accessed without further checks, an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` may be thrown, because there is no guarantee that the array is not empty.

    This problem occurs when user input is used as the size during array initialization, either directly or following one or more calculations. If the user input is unvalidated, it may cause the size of the array to be zero.


    ## Recommendation
    The size used in the array initialization should be verified to be greater than zero before being used. Alternatively, the array access may be protected by a conditional check that ensures it is only accessed if the index is less than the array size.


    ## Example
    The following program constructs an array with the size specified by some user input:


    ```java
    public class ImproperValidationOfArrayIndex extends HttpServlet {

      protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
        try {
          // User provided value
          int numberOfItems = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("numberOfItems").trim());

          if (numberOfItems >= 0) {
            /*
             * BAD numberOfItems may be zero, which would cause the array indexing operation to
             * throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
             */
            String items = new String[numberOfItems];
            items[0] = "Item 1";
          }

          if (numberOfItems > 0) {
            /*
             * GOOD numberOfItems must be greater than zero, so the indexing succeeds.
             */
            String items = new String[numberOfItems];
            items[0] = "Item 1";
          }

        } catch (NumberFormatException e) { }
      }
    }
    ```
    The first array construction is protected by a condition that checks if the user input is zero or more. However, if the user provides `0` as the `numberOfItems` parameter, then an empty array is created, and any array access would fail with an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

    The second array construction is protected by a condition that checks if the user input is greater than zero. The array will therefore never be empty, and the following array access will not throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

    # Improper validation of code-specified size used for array construction
    Constructing an array using a size that may be zero can result in the creation of an empty array. If an empty array is accessed without further checks, an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown.

    This can happen when a fixed value of zero, or a random value that may be zero, is used as the size directly.


    ## Recommendation
    The size used in the array initialization should be verified to be greater than zero before being used. Alternatively, the array access may be placed within a conditional that ensures it is only accessed if the index is less than the array size.


    ## Example
    The following program constructs an array with the size specified by some random value:


    ```java
    public class PossibleArrayIndexOutOfBounds {

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          int numberOfItems = new Random().nextInt(10);

          if (numberOfItems >= 0) {
            /*
             * BAD numberOfItems may be zero, which would cause the array indexing operation to
             * throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
             */
            String items = new String[numberOfItems];
            items[0] = "Item 1";
          }

          if (numberOfItems > 0) {
            /*
             * GOOD numberOfItems must be greater than zero, so the indexing succeeds.
             */
            String items = new String[numberOfItems];
            items[0] = "Item 1";
          }
      }
    }
    ```
    The first array construction is protected by a condition that checks if the random value is zero or more. However, if the random value is `0` then an empty array is created, and any array access would fail with an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

    The second array construction is protected by a condition that checks if the random value is greater than zero. The array will therefore never be empty, and the following array access will not throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

    # Improper validation of user-provided array index
    Using unvalidated input as part of an index into the array can cause the array access to throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This is because there is no guarantee that the index provided is within the bounds of the array.

    This problem occurs when user input is used as an array index, either directly or following one or more calculations. If the user input is unsanitized, it may be any value, which could result in either a negative index, or an index which is larger than the size of the array, either of which would result in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.


    ## Recommendation
    The index used in the array access should be checked against the bounds of the array before being used. The index should be smaller than the array size, and it should not be negative.


    ## Example
    The following program accesses an element from a fixed size constant array:


    ```java
    public class ImproperValidationOfArrayIndex extends HttpServlet {

      protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
        String[] productDescriptions = new String[] { "Chocolate bar", "Fizzy drink" };

        // User provided value
        String productID = request.getParameter("productID");
        try {
            int productID = Integer.parseInt(userProperty.trim());

            /*
             * BAD Array is accessed without checking if the user provided value is out of
             * bounds.
             */
            String productDescription = productDescriptions[productID];

            if (productID >= 0 && productID < productDescriptions.length) {
              // GOOD We have checked that the array index is valid first
              productDescription = productDescriptions[productID];
            } else {
              productDescription = "No product for that ID";
            }

            response.getWriter().write(productDescription);

        } catch (NumberFormatException e) { }
      }
    }
    ```
    The first access of the `productDescriptions` array uses the user-provided value as the index without performing any checks. If the user provides a negative value, or a value larger than the size of the array, then an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` may be thrown.

    The second access of the `productDescriptions` array is contained within a conditional expression that verifies the user-provided value is a valid index into the array. This ensures that the access operation never throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

    # Improper validation of code-specified array index
    Using a hard-coded or randomly provided value as the index to an array access can cause that array access to throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if the value is outside the bounds of that array.

    This problem occurs when a literal value, or a value generated using the `Random`, is used as an index for an array access operation. If one or more of the range of values produced by the random operation, or the fixed value of the literal, is outside the bounds of the array then this can cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.


    ## Recommendation
    If the index is a literal value, then the literal value may need to be modified to specify an index that is guaranteed to lie within the bounds of the array. Alternatively, the literal value may represent a default value that was never intended to be used in the array access, in which case the logic should be modified to ensure the default value is never used.

    For indices that flow from randomly generated values, either the random operation should be modified to generate a value that is guaranteed to be within the bounds of the array, or the array access should be protected by suitable conditional checks that verify the index is smaller than the length and larger than or equal to zero.


    ## Example
    The following program searches through an array to find the index at which some search text matches:


    ```java
    public class ImproperValidationOfArrayIndex extends HttpServlet {

      protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
      throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Search for products in productDescriptions that match the search term
        String searchTerm = request.getParameter("productSearchTerm");
        int foundProductID = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < productDescriptions.length; i++) {
          if (productDescriptions[i].contains(searchTerm)) {
            // Found matching product
            foundProductID = i;
            break;
          }
        }

        // BAD We may not have found a product in which case the index would be -1
        response.getWriter().write(productDescriptions[foundProductID]);

        if (foundProductID >= 0) {
          // GOOD We have checked we found a product first
          response.getWriter().write(productDescriptions[foundProductID]);
        } else {
          response.getWriter().write("No product found");
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    If the search text is not found, `foundProductID` is set to the default value - specified as `-1`. In the first access, `foundProductID` is used without checking whether the index is `-1`. This code can therefore throw a `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` if the search text is not found.

    In the second case, the array access is protected by a conditional that verifies the index is greater than or equal to zero. This ensures that an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` cannot be thrown.

  queryHelp: "# Use of externally-controlled format string\nThe `String.format` method\
    \ and related methods, like `PrintStream.printf` and `Formatter.format`, all accept\
    \ a format string that is used to format the trailing arguments to the format\
    \ call by providing inline format specifiers. If the format string contains unsanitized\
    \ input from an untrusted source, then that string may contain extra format specifiers\
    \ that cause an exception to be thrown or information to be leaked.\n\nThe Java\
    \ standard library implementation for the format methods throws an exception if\
    \ either the format specifier does not match the type of the argument, or if there\
    \ are too few or too many arguments. If unsanitized input is used in the format\
    \ string, it may contain invalid extra format specifiers which cause an exception\
    \ to be thrown.\n\nPositional format specifiers may be used to access an argument\
    \ to the format call by position. Unsanitized input in the format string may use\
    \ a positional format specifier to access information that was not intended to\
    \ be visible. For example, when formatting a Calendar instance we may intend to\

    \ to access the month and day.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIf the argument passed\
    \ as a format string is meant to be a plain string rather than a format string,\
    \ then pass `%s` as the format string, and pass the original argument as the sole\
    \ trailing argument.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following program is meant to check\
    \ a card security code for a stored credit card:\n\n\n```java\npublic class ResponseSplitting\
    \ extends HttpServlet {\n  protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse\
    \ response)\n  throws ServletException, IOException {\n    Calendar expirationDate\
    \ = new GregorianCalendar(2017, GregorianCalendar.SEPTEMBER, 1);\n    // User\
    \ provided value\n    String cardSecurityCode = request.getParameter(\"cardSecurityCode\"\
    );\n    \n    if (notValid(cardSecurityCode)) {\n      \n      /*\n       * BAD:\
    \ user provided value is included in the format string.\n       * A malicious\
    \ user could provide an extra format specifier, which causes an\n       * exception\
    \ to be thrown. Or they could provide a %1$tm or %1$te format specifier to\n \
    \      * access the month or day of the expiration date.\n       */\n      System.out.format(cardSecurityCode\
    \ +\n                          \" is not the right value. Hint: the card expires\
    \ in %1$ty.\",\n                        expirationDate);\n      \n      // GOOD:\
    \ %s is used to include the user-provided cardSecurityCode in the output\n   \
    \   System.out.format(\"%s is not the right value. Hint: the card expires in %2$ty.\"\
    ,\n                        cardSecurityCode,\n                        expirationDate);\n\
    \    }\n\n  }\n}\n```\nHowever, in the first format call it uses the cardSecurityCode\
    \ provided by the user in a format string. If the user includes a format specifier\
    \ in the cardSecurityCode field, they may be able to cause an exception to be\
    \ thrown, or to be able to access extra information about the stored card expiration\
    \ date.\n\nThe second format call shows the correct approach. The user-provided\
    \ value is passed as an argument to the format call. This prevents any format\
    \ specifiers in the user provided value from being evaluated.\n\n\n## References\n\

    # Exposure of sensitive information to notifications
    Sensitive information such as passwords or two-factor authentication (2FA) codes should not be exposed in a system notification. Notifications should not be considered secure, as other untrusted applications may be able to use a `NotificationListenerService` to read the contents of notifications.


    ## Recommendation
    Do not expose sensitive data in notifications.


    ## Example
    In the following sample, the `password` is sent as part of a notification. This can allow another application to read this password.


    ```java
    // BAD: `password` is exposed in a notification.
    void confirmPassword(String password) {
        NotificationManager manager = NotificationManager.from(this);
        manager.send(
            new Notification.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
            .setContentText("Your password is: " + password)
            .build());
    }

    # Exposure of sensitive information to UI text views
    Sensitive information such as passwords should not be displayed in UI components unless explicitly required, to mitigate shoulder-surfing attacks.


    ## Recommendation
    For editable text fields containing sensitive information, the `inputType` should be set to `textPassword` or similar to ensure it is properly masked. Otherwise, sensitive data that must be displayed should be hidden by default, and only revealed based on an explicit user action.


    ## Example
    In the following (bad) case, sensitive information in `password` is exposed to the `TextView`.


    ```java
    TextView pwView = getViewById(R.id.pw_text);
    pwView.setText("Your password is: " + password);
    ```
    In the following (good) case, the user must press a button to reveal sensitive information.


    ```java
    TextView pwView = findViewById(R.id.pw_text);
    pwView.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);
    pwView.setText("Your password is: " + password);

    Button showButton = findViewById(R.id.show_pw_button);
    showButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        public void onClick(View v) {
          pwView.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
        }
    });

    # Android WebView settings allows access to content links
    Android can provide access to content providers within a WebView using the `setAllowContentAccess` setting.

    Allowing access to content providers via `content://` URLs may allow JavaScript to access protected content.


    ## Recommendation
    If your app does not require access to the `content://` URL functionality, you should explicitly disable the setting by calling `setAllowContentAccess(false)` on the settings of the WebView.


    ## Example
    In the following (bad) example, access to `content://` URLs is explicitly allowed.


    ```java
    WebSettings settings = webview.getSettings();

    settings.setAllowContentAccess(true);

    ```
    In the following (good) example, access to `content://` URLs is explicitly denied.

    settings.setAllowContentAccess(false);

    # Android WebSettings file access
    Allowing file access in an Android WebView can expose a device's file system to the JavaScript running in that WebView. If the JavaScript contains vulnerabilities or the WebView loads untrusted content, file access allows an attacker to steal the user's data.


    ## Recommendation
    When possible, do not allow file access. The file access settings are disabled by default. You can explicitly disable file access by setting the following settings to `false`:

    * `setAllowFileAccess`
    * `setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs`
    * `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs`
    If your application requires access to the file system, it is best to avoid using `file://` URLs. Instead, use an alternative that loads files via HTTPS, such as `androidx.webkit.WebViewAssetLoader`.


    ## Example
    In the following (bad) example, the WebView is configured with settings that allow local file access.


    ```java
    WebSettings settings = view.getSettings();

    settings.setAllowFileAccess(true);
    settings.setAllowFileAccessFromURLs(true);
    settings.setAllowUniversalAccessFromURLs(true);

    ```
    In the following (good) example, the WebView is configured to disallow file access.


    ```java
    WebSettings settings = view.getSettings();

    settings.setAllowFileAccess(false);
    settings.setAllowFileAccessFromURLs(false);
    settings.setAllowUniversalAccessFromURLs(false);

    ```
    As mentioned previously, asset loaders can load files without file system access. In the following (good) example, an asset loader is configured to load assets over HTTPS.


    ```java
    WebViewAssetLoader loader = new WebViewAssetLoader.Builder()
        // Replace the domain with a domain you control, or use the default
        // appassets.androidplatform.com
        .setDomain("appassets.example.com")
        .addPathHandler("/resources", new AssetsPathHandler(this))
        .build();

    webView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClientCompat() {
        @Override
        public WebResourceResponse shouldInterceptRequest(WebView view, WebResourceRequest request) {
            return assetLoader.shouldInterceptRequest(request.getUrl());
        }
    });

    webView.loadUrl("https://appassets.example.com/resources/www/index.html");

    ```

    # Local information disclosure in a temporary directory
    Local information disclosure can occur when files/directories are written into directories that are shared between all users on the system.

    On most [unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) systems, the system temporary directory is shared between local users. If files/directories are created within the system temporary directory without using APIs that explicitly set the correct file permissions, local information disclosure can occur.

    Depending upon the particular file contents exposed, this vulnerability can have a [CVSSv3.1 base score of 6.2/10](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1).


    ## Recommendation
    Use JDK methods that specifically protect against this vulnerability:

    * [java.nio.file.Files.createTempDirectory](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#createTempDirectory-java.nio.file.Path-java.lang.String-java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...-)
    * [java.nio.file.Files.createTempFile](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#createTempFile-java.nio.file.Path-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...-)
    Otherwise, create the file/directory by manually specifying the expected posix file permissions. For example: `PosixFilePermissions.asFileAttribute(EnumSet.of(PosixFilePermission.OWNER_READ, PosixFilePermission.OWNER_WRITE))`

    * [java.nio.file.Files.createFile](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#createFile-java.nio.file.Path-java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...-)
    * [java.nio.file.Files.createDirectory](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#createDirectory-java.nio.file.Path-java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...-)
    * [java.nio.file.Files.createDirectories](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#createDirectories-java.nio.file.Path-java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...-)

    ## Example
    In the following example, files and directories are created with file permissions that allow other local users to read their contents.


    ```java
    import java.io.File;

    public class TempDirUsageVulnerable {
        void exampleVulnerable() {
            File temp1 = File.createTempFile("random", ".txt"); // BAD: File has permissions `-rw-r--r--`

            File temp2 = File.createTempFile("random", "file", null); // BAD: File has permissions `-rw-r--r--`

            File systemTempDir = new File(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"));
            File temp3 = File.createTempFile("random", "file", systemTempDir); // BAD: File has permissions `-rw-r--r--`

            File tempDir = com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(); // BAD: CVE-2020-8908: Directory has permissions `drwxr-xr-x`

            new File(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), "/child").mkdir(); // BAD: Directory has permissions `-rw-r--r--`

            File tempDirChildFile = new File(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), "/child-create-file.txt");
            Files.createFile(tempDirChildFile.toPath()); // BAD: File has permissions `-rw-r--r--`

            File tempDirChildDir = new File(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), "/child-dir");
            tempDirChildDir.mkdir(); // BAD: Directory has permissions `drwxr-xr-x`
            Files.createDirectory(tempDirChildDir.toPath()); // BAD: Directory has permissions `drwxr-xr-x`
        }
    }

    ```
    In the following example, files and directories are created with file permissions that protect their contents.


    ```java
    import java.io.File;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.io.UncheckedIOException;

    # Intent URI permission manipulation
    When an Android component expects a result from an Activity, `startActivityForResult` can be used. The started Activity can then use `setResult` to return the appropriate data to the calling component.

    If an Activity obtains the incoming, user-provided Intent and directly returns it via `setResult` without any checks, the application may be unintentionally giving arbitrary access to its content providers, even if they are not exported, as long as they are configured with the attribute `android:grantUriPermissions="true"`. This happens because the attacker adds the appropriate URI permission flags to the provided Intent, which take effect once the Intent is reflected back.


    ## Recommendation
    Avoid returning user-provided or untrusted Intents via `setResult`. Use a new Intent instead.

    If it is required to use the received Intent, make sure that it does not contain URI permission flags, either by checking them with `Intent.getFlags` or removing them with `Intent.removeFlags`.


    ## Example
    The following sample contains three examples. In the first example, a user-provided Intent is obtained and directly returned back with `setResult`, which is dangerous. In the second example, a new Intent is created to safely return the desired data. The third example shows how the obtained Intent can be sanitized by removing dangerous flags before using it to return data to the calling component.


    ```java
    public class IntentUriPermissionManipulation extends Activity {

        // BAD: the user-provided Intent is returned as-is
        public void dangerous() {
            Intent intent = getIntent();
            intent.putExtra("result", "resultData");
            setResult(intent);
        }

        // GOOD: a new Intent is created and returned
        public void safe() {
            Intent intent = new Intent();
            intent.putExtra("result", "resultData");
            setResult(intent);
        }

        // GOOD: the user-provided Intent is sanitized before being returned
        public void sanitized() {
            Intent intent = getIntent();
            intent.putExtra("result", "resultData");
            intent.removeFlags(
                    Intent.FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION | Intent.FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION);
            setResult(intent);
        }
    }

    ```

    \ an attacker with physical access can bypass the authentication check using application\
    \ hooking tools such as Frida.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nWhen generating a key for\
    \ use with biometric authentication, ensure that the following parameters of `KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder`\

    # Insecure local authentication
    Biometric local authentication such as fingerprint recognition can be used to protect sensitive data or actions within an application. However, if this authentication does not use a `KeyStore`-backed key, it can be bypassed by a privileged malicious application, or by an attacker with physical access using application hooking tools such as Frida.


    ## Recommendation
    Generate a secure key in the Android `KeyStore`. Ensure that the `onAuthenticationSuccess` callback for a biometric prompt uses it in a way that is required for the sensitive parts of the application to function, such as by using it to decrypt sensitive data or credentials.


    ## Example
    In the following (bad) case, no `CryptoObject` is required for the biometric prompt to grant access, so it can be bypassed.


    ```java
    biometricPrompt.authenticate(
        cancellationSignal,
        executor,
        new BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback {
            @Override
            // BAD: This authentication callback does not make use of a `CryptoObject` from the `result`.
            public void onAuthenticationSucceeded(BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult result) {
                grantAccess()
            }
        }
    )
    ```
    In the following (good) case, a secret key is generated in the Android `KeyStore`. The application requires this secret key for access, using it to decrypt data.


    ```java
    private void generateSecretKey() {
        KeyGenParameterSpec keyGenParameterSpec = new KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder(
            "MySecretKey",
            KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT | KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT)
            .setBlockModes(KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_CBC)
            .setEncryptionPaddings(KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_PKCS7)
            .setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)
            .setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment(true)
            .build();
        KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance(
                KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_AES, "AndroidKeyStore");
        keyGenerator.init(keyGenParameterSpec);
        keyGenerator.generateKey();
    }


    private SecretKey getSecretKey() {
        KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("AndroidKeyStore");
        keyStore.load(null);
        return ((SecretKey)keyStore.getKey("MySecretKey", null));
    }

    private Cipher getCipher() {
        return Cipher.getInstance(KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_AES + "/"
                + KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_CBC + "/"
                + KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_PKCS7);
    }

    public prompt(byte[] encryptedData) {
        Cipher cipher = getCipher();
        SecretKey secretKey = getSecretKey();
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);

        biometricPrompt.authenticate(
            new BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject(cipher),
            cancellationSignal,
            executor,
            new BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback() {
                @Override
                // GOOD: This authentication callback uses the result to decrypt some data.
                public void onAuthenticationSucceeded(BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationResult result) {
                    Cipher cipher = result.getCryptoObject().getCipher();
                    byte[] decryptedData = cipher.doFinal(encryptedData);
                    grantAccessWithData(decryptedData);
                }
            }
        );
    }
    ```

  queryHelp: "# Android missing certificate pinning\nCertificate pinning is the practice\
    \ of only trusting a specific set of SSL certificates, rather than those that\
    \ the device trusts by default. In Android applications, it is reccomended to\
    \ use certificate pinning when communicating over the network, in order to minimize\
    \ the risk of machine-in-the-middle attacks from a compromised CA.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
    The easiest way to implement certificate pinning is to declare your pins in a\
    \ `network-security-config` XML file. This will automatically provide certificate\
    \ pinning for any network connection made by the app.\n\nAnother way to implement\
    \ certificate pinning is to use the \\`CertificatePinner\\` class from the \\\
    `okhttp\\` library.\n\nA final way to implement certificate pinning is to use\
    \ a `TrustManager`, initialized from a `KeyStore` loaded with only the necessary\
    \ certificates.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the first (bad) case below, a network call\
    \ is performed with no certificate pinning implemented. The other (good) cases\
    \ demonstrate the different ways to implement certificate pinning.\n\n\n```java\n\
    // BAD - By default, this network call does not use certificate pinning\nURLConnection\

  queryHelp: "# Unsafe hostname verification\nIf a `HostnameVerifier` always returns\
    \ `true` it will not verify the hostname at all. This stops Transport Layer Security\
    \ (TLS) providing any security and allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack against the application.\n\nAn attack might look like this:\n\n1. The\
    \ program connects to `https://example.com`.\n1. The attacker intercepts this\
    \ connection and presents an apparently-valid certificate of their choosing.\n\
    1. The `TrustManager` of the program verifies that the certificate has been issued\
    \ by a trusted certificate authority.\n1. The Java HTTPS library checks whether\
    \ the certificate has been issued for the host `example.com`. This check fails\
    \ because the certificate has been issued for a domain controlled by the attacker,\
    \ for example: `malicious.domain`.\n1. The HTTPS library wants to reject the certificate\
    \ because the hostname does not match. Before doing this it checks whether a `HostnameVerifier`\
    \ exists.\n1. Your `HostnameVerifier` is called which returns `true` for any certificate\
    \ so also for this one.\n1. The program proceeds with the connection since your\
    \ `HostnameVerifier` accepted it.\n1. The attacker can now read the data your\
    \ program sends to `https://example.com` and/or alter its replies while the program\
    \ thinks the connection is secure.\n\n## Recommendation\nDo not use an open `HostnameVerifier`.\
    \ If you have a configuration problem with TLS/HTTPS, you should always solve\
    \ the configuration problem instead of using an open verifier.\n\n\n## Example\n\
    In the first (bad) example, the `HostnameVerifier` always returns `true`. This\
    \ allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, because any certificate\
    \ is accepted despite an incorrect hostname. In the second (good) example, the\
    \ `HostnameVerifier` only returns `true` when the certificate has been correctly\
    \ checked.\n\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\n\t{\n\t\t\

    # Application backup allowed
    In the Android manifest file, you can use the `android:allowBackup` attribute of the `application` element to define whether the application will have automatic backups or not.

    If your application uses any sensitive data, you should disable automatic backups to prevent attackers from extracting it.


    ## Recommendation
    For Android applications which process sensitive data, set `android:allowBackup` to `false` in the manifest file.

    Note: Since Android 6.0 (Marshmallow), automatic backups for applications are switched on by default.


    ## Example
    In the following two (bad) examples, the `android:allowBackup` setting is enabled:


    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <!-- BAD: 'android:allowBackup' set to 'true' -->
        <application
            android:allowBackup="true">
            <activity ... >
            </activity>
        </application>
    </manifest>

    ```

    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <!-- BAD: no 'android:allowBackup' set, defaults to 'true' -->
        <application>
            <activity ... >
            </activity>
        </application>
    </manifest>

    ```
    In the following (good) example, `android:allowBackup` is set to `false`:


    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <!-- GOOD: 'android:allowBackup' set to 'false' -->
        <application
            android:allowBackup="false">
            <activity ... >
            </activity>
        </application>
    </manifest>

    ```

  queryHelp: "# Cleartext storage of sensitive information using 'Properties' class\n\
    Sensitive information that is stored unencrypted is accessible to an attacker\
    \ who gains access to the storage.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that sensitive\
    \ information is always encrypted before being stored. It may be wise to encrypt\
    \ information before it is put into a heap data structure (such as `Java.util.Properties`)\
    \ that may be written to disk later. Objects that are serializable or marshallable\
    \ should also always contain encrypted information unless you are certain that\
    \ they are not ever going to be serialized.\n\nIn general, decrypt sensitive information\
    \ only at the point where it is necessary for it to be used in cleartext.\n\n\n\
    ## Example\nThe following example shows two ways of storing user credentials in\
    \ a cookie. In the 'BAD' case, the credentials are simply stored in cleartext.\
    \ In the 'GOOD' case, the credentials are hashed before storing them.\n\n\n```java\n\

    \t\tdata = credentials.getUserName() + \":\" + new String(credentials.getPassword());\n\
    \t\n\t\t// BAD: store data in a cookie in cleartext form\n\t\tresponse.addCookie(new\
    \ Cookie(\"auth\", data));\n\t}\n\t\n\t{\n\t\tString data;\n\t\tPasswordAuthentication\
    \ credentials =\n\t\t\t\tnew PasswordAuthentication(\"user\", \"GP@ssw0rd\".toCharArray());\n\
    \t\tString salt = \"ThisIsMySalt\";\n\t\tMessageDigest messageDigest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"\

    # Failure to use SSL socket factories
    Various networking and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) methods may use `SocketFactories` to specify the kind of connections to use. Using the default factory or a non-SSL factory leads to vulnerable connections.


    ## Recommendation
    Use SSL factories instead of the default factories. SSL factories can be found in `javax.net.ssl` or `java.rmi.ssl`. If you want to define your own custom factories, consider inheriting from one of the SSL factories.


    ## Example
    The following example shows two ways of using RMI to export an object. The first use of `exportObject` uses the default socket factories. The second use of `exportObject` uses explicit SSL factories, which are preferable.


    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        {
            try {
                TestImpl obj = new TestImpl();

                // BAD: default socket factory is used
                Test stub = (Test) UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(obj, 0);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // fail
            }
        }

        {
            try {
                TestImpl obj = new TestImpl();
                SslRMIClientSocketFactory csf = new SslRMIClientSocketFactory();
                SslRMIServerSocketFactory ssf = new SslRMIServerSocketFactory();

                // GOOD: SSL factories are used
                Test stub = (Test) UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(obj, 0, csf, ssf);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // fail

    # Use of a cryptographic algorithm with insufficient key size
    Modern encryption relies on the computational infeasibility of breaking a cipher and decoding its message without the key. As computational power increases, the ability to break ciphers grows, and key sizes need to become larger as a result. Cryptographic algorithms that use too small of a key size are vulnerable to brute force attacks, which can reveal sensitive data.


    ## Recommendation
    Use a key of the recommended size or larger. The key size should be at least 128 bits for AES encryption, 256 bits for elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), and 2048 bits for RSA, DSA, or DH encryption.


    ## Example
    The following code uses cryptographic algorithms with insufficient key sizes.


    ```java
        KeyPairGenerator keyPairGen1 = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA");
        keyPairGen1.initialize(1024); // BAD: Key size is less than 2048

        KeyPairGenerator keyPairGen2 = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("DSA");
        keyPairGen2.initialize(1024); // BAD: Key size is less than 2048

        KeyPairGenerator keyPairGen3 = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("DH");
        keyPairGen3.initialize(1024); // BAD: Key size is less than 2048

        KeyPairGenerator keyPairGen4 = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("EC");
        ECGenParameterSpec ecSpec = new ECGenParameterSpec("secp112r1"); // BAD: Key size is less than 256
        keyPairGen4.initialize(ecSpec);

        KeyGenerator keyGen = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");
        keyGen.init(64); // BAD: Key size is less than 128

    ```
    To fix the code, change the key sizes to be the recommended size or larger for each algorithm.

    # Insecure randomness
    If you use a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator to generate security-sensitive values, such as passwords, attackers can more easily predict those values.

    Pseudo-random number generators generate a sequence of numbers that only approximates the properties of random numbers. The sequence is not truly random because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values (the seed). If the random number generator is cryptographically weak, then this sequence may be easily predictable through outside observations.


    ## Recommendation
    The `java.util.Random` random number generator is not cryptographically secure. Use a secure random number generator such as `java.security.SecureRandom` instead.

    Use a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator if the output is to be used in a security-sensitive context. As a general rule, a value should be considered "security-sensitive" if predicting it would allow the attacker to perform an action that they would otherwise be unable to perform. For example, if an attacker could predict the random password generated for a new user, they would be able to log in as that new user.


    ## Example
    The following examples show different ways of generating a cookie with a random value.

    In the first (BAD) case, we generate a fresh cookie by appending a random integer to the end of a static string. The random number generator used (`Random`) is not cryptographically secure, so it may be possible for an attacker to predict the generated cookie.


    ```java
    Random r = new Random();

    byte[] bytes = new byte[16];
    r.nextBytes(bytes);

    String cookieValue = encode(bytes);

    Cookie cookie = new Cookie("name", cookieValue);
    response.addCookie(cookie);

    ```
    In the second (GOOD) case, we generate a fresh cookie by appending a random integer to the end of a static string. The random number generator used (`SecureRandom`) is cryptographically secure, so it is not possible for an attacker to predict the generated cookie.


    ```java
    SecureRandom r = new SecureRandom();

    byte[] bytes = new byte[16];
    r.nextBytes(bytes);

    String cookieValue = encode(bytes);

    Cookie cookie = new Cookie("name", cookieValue);
    response.addCookie(cookie);

    ```

    # Use of a predictable seed in a secure random number generator
    Using a predictable seed in a pseudo-random number generator can lead to predictability of the numbers generated by it.


    ## Recommendation
    If the predictability of the pseudo-random number generator does not matter then consider using the faster `Random` class from `java.util`. If it is important that the pseudo-random number generator produces completely unpredictable values then either let the generator securely seed itself by not specifying a seed or specify a randomly generated, unpredictable seed.


    ## Example
    In the first example shown here, a constant value is used as a seed. Depending on the implementation of ` SecureRandom`, this could lead to the same random number being generated each time the code is executed.

    In the second example shown here, the system time is used as a seed. Depending on the implementation of ` SecureRandom`, if an attacker knows what time the code was run, they could predict the generated random number.

    In the third example shown here, the random number generator is allowed to generate its own seed, which it will do in a secure way.


    ```java
    SecureRandom prng = new SecureRandom();
    int randomData = 0;

    // BAD: Using a constant value as a seed for a random number generator means all numbers it generates are predictable.
    prng.setSeed(12345L);
    randomData = prng.next(32);

    // BAD: System.currentTimeMillis() returns the system time which is predictable.
    prng.setSeed(System.currentTimeMillis());
    randomData = prng.next(32);

    // GOOD: SecureRandom implementations seed themselves securely by default.
    prng = new SecureRandom();
    randomData = prng.next(32);

    ```

    # Detect JHipster Generator Vulnerability CVE-2019-16303
    This query detects instances of `RandomUtil.java` that were generated by a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) version that is vulnerable to [CVE-2019-16303](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin/security/advisories/GHSA-j3rh-8vwq-wh84).

    If an app uses `RandomUtil.java` generated by a vulnerable version of JHipster, attackers can request a password reset token and use this to predict the value of future reset tokens generated by this server. Using this information, they can create a reset link that allows them to take over any account.

    This vulnerability has a [ CVSS v3.0 Base Score of 9.8/10 ](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2019-16303&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1&source=NIST).


    ## Example
    The example below shows the vulnerable `RandomUtil` class generated by [JHipster prior to version 6.3.0](https://www.jhipster.tech/2019/09/13/jhipster-release-6.3.0.html).


    ```java
    import org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils;

    /**
     * Utility class for generating random Strings.
     */
    public final class RandomUtil {

        private static final int DEF_COUNT = 20;

        private RandomUtil() {
        }

        /**
         * Generate a password.
         *
         * @return the generated password.
         */
        public static String generatePassword() {
            return RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(DEF_COUNT); // BAD: RandomStringUtils does not use SecureRandom
        }

        /**
         * Generate an activation key.
         *
         * @return the generated activation key.
         */
        public static String generateActivationKey() {
            return RandomStringUtils.randomNumeric(DEF_COUNT); // BAD: RandomStringUtils does not use SecureRandom
        }

        /**

        public static String generateResetKey() {
            return RandomStringUtils.randomNumeric(DEF_COUNT); // BAD: RandomStringUtils does not use SecureRandom
        }

        /**

        public static String generateSeriesData() {
            return RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(DEF_COUNT); // BAD: RandomStringUtils does not use SecureRandom
        }

        /**

         */
        public static String generateTokenData() {
            return RandomStringUtils.randomAlphanumeric(DEF_COUNT); // BAD: RandomStringUtils does not use SecureRandom
        }
    }

    ```
    Below is a fixed version of the `RandomUtil` class.


    ```java
    import org.apache.commons.lang3.RandomStringUtils;

    import java.security.SecureRandom;

    /**
     * Utility class for generating random Strings.
     */
    public final class RandomUtil {
        private static final SecureRandom SECURE_RANDOM = new SecureRandom(); // GOOD: Using SecureRandom

        private static final int DEF_COUNT = 20;

        static {
            SECURE_RANDOM.nextBytes(new byte[64]);
        }

        private RandomUtil() {
        }

        private static String generateRandomAlphanumericString() {
            // GOOD: Passing Secure Random to RandomStringUtils::random
            return RandomStringUtils.random(DEF_COUNT, 0, 0, true, true, null, SECURE_RANDOM);
        }

        /**
         * Generate a password.
         *
         * @return the generated password.
         */
        public static String generatePassword() {
            return generateRandomAlphanumericString();
        }

        /**
         * Generate an activation key.
         *
         * @return the generated activation key.
         */
        public static String generateActivationKey() {
            return generateRandomAlphanumericString();
        }

        /**
         * Generate a reset key.
         *

         */
        public static String generateResetKey() {
            return generateRandomAlphanumericString();
        }

        /**
         * Generate a unique series to validate a persistent token, used in the
         * authentication remember-me mechanism.
         *
         * @return the generated series data.
         */
        public static String generateSeriesData() {
            return generateRandomAlphanumericString();
        }

        /**
         * Generate a persistent token, used in the authentication remember-me mechanism.
         *

         */
        public static String generateTokenData() {
            return generateRandomAlphanumericString();
        }
    }

    ```

    ## Recommendation
    You should refactor the `RandomUtil` class and replace every call to `RandomStringUtils.randomAlphaNumeric`. You could regenerate the class using the latest version of JHipster, or use an automated refactoring. For example, using the [Patching JHipster CWE-338](https://github.com/moderneinc/jhipster-cwe-338) for the [Rewrite project](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite).

    # Missing JWT signature check
    A JSON Web Token (JWT) consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature. The `io.jsonwebtoken.jjwt` library is one of many libraries used for working with JWTs. It offers different methods for parsing tokens like `parse`, `parseClaimsJws`, and `parsePlaintextJws`. The last two correctly verify that the JWT is properly signed. This is done by computing the signature of the combination of header and payload and comparing the locally computed signature with the signature part of the JWT.

    Therefore it is necessary to provide the `JwtParser` with a key that is used for signature validation. Unfortunately the `parse` method **accepts** a JWT whose signature is empty although a signing key has been set for the parser. This means that an attacker can create arbitrary JWTs that will be accepted if this method is used.


    ## Recommendation
    Always verify the signature by using either the `parseClaimsJws` and `parsePlaintextJws` methods or by overriding the `onPlaintextJws` or `onClaimsJws` of `JwtHandlerAdapter`.


    ## Example
    The following example shows four cases where a signing key is set for a parser. In the first 'BAD' case the `parse` method is used, which will not validate the signature. The second 'BAD' case uses a `JwtHandlerAdapter` where the `onPlaintextJwt` method is overriden, so it will not validate the signature. The third and fourth 'GOOD' cases use `parseClaimsJws` method or override the `onPlaintextJws` method.


    ```java
    public void badJwt(String token) {
        Jwts.parserBuilder()
                    .setSigningKey("someBase64EncodedKey").build()
                    .parse(token); // BAD: Does not verify the signature
    }

    public void badJwtHandler(String token) {
        Jwts.parserBuilder()
                    .setSigningKey("someBase64EncodedKey").build()
                    .parse(plaintextJwt, new JwtHandlerAdapter<Jwt<Header, String>>() {
                        @Override
                        public Jwt<Header, String> onPlaintextJwt(Jwt<Header, String> jwt) {
                            return jwt;
                        }
                    }); // BAD: The handler is called on an unverified JWT
    }

    public void goodJwt(String token) {
        Jwts.parserBuilder()
                    .setSigningKey("someBase64EncodedKey").build()
                    .parseClaimsJws(token) // GOOD: Verify the signature
                    .getBody();
    }

    public void goodJwtHandler(String token) {
        Jwts.parserBuilder()
                    .setSigningKey("someBase64EncodedKey").build()
                    .parse(plaintextJwt, new JwtHandlerAdapter<Jws<String>>() {
                        @Override
                        public Jws<String> onPlaintextJws(Jws<String> jws) {
                            return jws;
                        }
                    }); // GOOD: The handler is called on a verified JWS
    }

  queryHelp: "# Time-of-check time-of-use race condition\nOften it is necessary to\
    \ check the state of a resource before using it. If the resource is accessed concurrently,\
    \ then the check and the use need to be performed atomically, otherwise the state\
    \ of the resource may change between the check and the use. This can lead to a\
    \ \"time-of-check/time-of-use\" (TOCTOU) race condition.\n\nIn Java, classes may\
    \ present state inspection methods and operation methods which are synchronized.\
    \ This prevents multiple threads from executing those methods simultaneously,\
    \ but it does not prevent a state change in between separate method invocations.\n\
    \n\n## Recommendation\nWhen calling a series of methods which require a consistent\
    \ view of an object, make sure to synchronize on a monitor that will prevent any\
    \ other access to the object during your operations.\n\nIf the class that you\
    \ are using has a well-designed interface, then synchronizing on the object itself\
    \ will prevent its state being changed inappropriately.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following\
    \ example shows a resource which has a readiness state, and an action that is\
    \ only valid if the resource is ready.\n\nIn the bad case, the caller checks the\
    \ readiness state and then acts, but does not synchronize around the two calls,\
    \ so the readiness state may be changed by another thread.\n\nIn the good case,\
    \ the caller jointly synchronizes the check and the use on the resource, so no\
    \ other thread can modify the state before the use.\n\n\n```java\nclass Resource\
    \ {\n\tpublic synchronized boolean isReady() { ... }\n\n\tpublic synchronized\
    \ void setReady(boolean ready) { ... }\n\t\n\tpublic synchronized void act() {\
    \ \n\t\tif (!isReady())\n\t\t\tthrow new IllegalStateException();\n\t\t...\n\t\
    }\n}\n\t\npublic synchronized void bad(Resource r) {\n\tif (r.isReady()) {\n\t\
    \t// r might no longer be ready, another thread might\n\t\t// have called setReady(false)\n\
    \t\tr.act();\n\t}\n}\n\npublic synchronized void good(Resource r) {\n\tsynchronized(r)\
    \ {\n\t\tif (r.isReady()) {\n\t\t\tr.act();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## References\n\

    # Uncontrolled data used in content resolution
    When an Android application wants to access data in a content provider, it uses the `ContentResolver` object. `ContentResolver`s communicate with an instance of a class that implements the `ContentProvider` interface via URIs with the `content://` scheme. The authority part (the first path segment) of the URI, passed as parameter to the `ContentResolver`, determines which content provider is contacted for the operation. Specific operations that act on files also support the `file://` scheme, in which case the local filesystem is queried instead. If an external component, like a malicious or compromised application, controls the URI for a `ContentResolver` operation, it can trick the vulnerable application into accessing its own private files or non-exported content providers. The attacking application might be able to get access to the file by forcing it to be copied to a public directory, like external storage, or tamper with the contents by making the application overwrite the file with unexpected data.


    ## Recommendation
    If possible, avoid using externally-provided data to determine the URI for a `ContentResolver` to use. If that is not an option, validate that the incoming URI can only reference trusted components, like an allow list of content providers and/or applications, or alternatively make sure that the URI does not reference private directories like `/data/`.


    ## Example
    This example shows three ways of opening a file using a `ContentResolver`. In the first case, externally-provided data from an intent is used directly in the file-reading operation. This allows an attacker to provide a URI of the form `/data/data/(vulnerable app package)/(private file)` to trick the application into reading it and copying it to the external storage. In the second case, an insufficient check is performed on the externally-provided URI, still leaving room for exploitation. In the third case, the URI is correctly validated before being used, making sure it does not reference any internal application files.


    ```java
    import android.content.ContentResolver;
    import android.net.Uri;

    public class Example extends Activity {
        public void onCreate() {
            // BAD: Externally-provided URI directly used in content resolution
            {
                ContentResolver contentResolver = getContentResolver();
                Uri uri = (Uri) getIntent().getParcelableExtra("URI_EXTRA");
                InputStream is = contentResolver.openInputStream(uri);
                copyToExternalCache(is);
            }
            // BAD: input URI is not normalized, and check can be bypassed with ".." characters
            {
                ContentResolver contentResolver = getContentResolver();
                Uri uri = (Uri) getIntent().getParcelableExtra("URI_EXTRA");
                String path = uri.getPath();
                if (path.startsWith("/data"))
                    throw new SecurityException();
                InputStream is = contentResolver.openInputStream(uri);
                copyToExternalCache(is);
            }
            // GOOD: URI is properly validated to block access to internal files
            {
                ContentResolver contentResolver = getContentResolver();
                Uri uri = (Uri) getIntent().getParcelableExtra("URI_EXTRA");
                String path = uri.getPath();
                java.nio.file.Path normalized =
                        java.nio.file.FileSystems.getDefault().getPath(path).normalize();
                if (normalized.startsWith("/data"))
                    throw new SecurityException();
                InputStream is = contentResolver.openInputStream(uri);
                copyToExternalCache(is);
            }
        }

        private void copyToExternalCache(InputStream is) {

            // cache directory, which can be read publicly by applications in the same device.
        }
    }

    # Android fragment injection
    When fragments are instantiated with externally provided names, this exposes any exported activity that dynamically creates and hosts the fragment to fragment injection. A malicious application could provide the name of an arbitrary fragment, even one not designed to be externally accessible, and inject it into the activity. This can bypass access controls and expose the application to unintended effects.

    Fragments are reusable parts of an Android application's user interface. Even though a fragment controls its own lifecycle and layout, and handles its input events, it cannot exist on its own: it must be hosted either by an activity or another fragment. This means that, normally, a fragment will be accessible by third-party applications (that is, exported) only if its hosting activity is itself exported.


    ## Recommendation
    In general, do not instantiate classes (including fragments) with user-provided names unless the name has been properly validated. Also, if an exported activity is extending the `PreferenceActivity` class, make sure that the `isValidFragment` method is overriden and only returns `true` when the provided `fragmentName` points to an intended fragment.


    ## Example
    The following example shows two cases: in the first one, untrusted data is used to instantiate and add a fragment to an activity, while in the second one, a fragment is safely added with a static name.


    ```java
    public class MyActivity extends FragmentActivity {

        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstance) {
            try {
                super.onCreate(savedInstance);
                // BAD: Fragment instantiated from user input without validation
                {
                    String fName = getIntent().getStringExtra("fragmentName");
                    getFragmentManager().beginTransaction().replace(com.android.internal.R.id.prefs,
                            Fragment.instantiate(this, fName, null)).commit();
                }
                // GOOD: Fragment instantiated statically
                {
                    getFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
                            .replace(com.android.internal.R.id.prefs, new MyFragment()).commit();
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
            }
        }

    }

    ```
    The next example shows two activities that extend `PreferenceActivity`. The first activity overrides `isValidFragment`, but it wrongly returns `true` unconditionally. The second activity correctly overrides `isValidFragment` so that it only returns `true` when `fragmentName` is a trusted fragment name.


    ```java
    class UnsafeActivity extends PreferenceActivity {

        @Override
        protected boolean isValidFragment(String fragmentName) {
            // BAD: any Fragment name can be provided.
            return true;
        }
    }


    class SafeActivity extends PreferenceActivity {
        @Override
        protected boolean isValidFragment(String fragmentName) {
            // Good: only trusted Fragment names are allowed.
            return SafeFragment1.class.getName().equals(fragmentName)
                    || SafeFragment2.class.getName().equals(fragmentName)
                    || SafeFragment3.class.getName().equals(fragmentName);
        }

    }


    ```

    # Android debuggable attribute enabled
    The Android manifest file defines configuration settings for Android applications. In this file, the `android:debuggable` attribute of the `application` element can be used to define whether or not the application can be debugged. When set to `true`, this attribute will allow the application to be debugged even when running on a device in user mode.

    When a debugger is enabled, it could allow for entry points in the application or reveal sensitive information. As a result, `android:debuggable` should only be enabled during development and should be disabled in production builds.


    ## Recommendation
    In Android applications, either set the `android:debuggable` attribute to `false`, or do not include it in the manifest. The default value, when not included, is `false`.


    ## Example
    In the example below, the `android:debuggable` attribute is set to `true`.


    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <!-- BAD: 'android:debuggable' set to 'true' -->
        <application
            android:debuggable="true">
            <activity ... >
            </activity>
        </application>
    </manifest>

    ```
    The corrected version sets the `android:debuggable` attribute to `false`.


    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <!-- GOOD: 'android:debuggable' set to 'false' -->
        <application
            android:debuggable="false">
            <activity ... >
            </activity>
        </application>
    </manifest>

    # Trust boundary violation
    A trust boundary violation occurs when a value is passed from a less trusted context to a more trusted context.

    For example, a value that is generated by a less trusted source, such as a user, may be passed to a more trusted source, such as a system process. If the less trusted source is malicious, then the value may be crafted to exploit the more trusted source.

    Trust boundary violations are often caused by a failure to validate input. For example, if a web application accepts a cookie from a user, then the application should validate the cookie before using it. If the cookie is not validated, then the user may be able to craft a malicious cookie that exploits the application.


    ## Recommendation
    To maintain a trust boundary, validate data from less trusted sources before use.


    ## Example
    In the first (bad) example, the server accepts a parameter from the user, then uses it to set the username without validation.


    ```java
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        String username = request.getParameter("username");

        // BAD: The input is written to the session without being sanitized.
        request.getSession().setAttribute("username", username);
    }
    ```
    In the second (good) example, the server validates the parameter from the user, then uses it to set the username.


    ```java
    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        String username = request.getParameter("username");

        if (validator.isValidInput("HTTP parameter", username, "username", 20, false)) {
            // GOOD: The input is sanitized before being written to the session.
            request.getSession().setAttribute("username", username);
        }
    }
    ```

    # Deserialization of user-controlled data
    Deserializing untrusted data using any deserialization framework that allows the construction of arbitrary serializable objects is easily exploitable and in many cases allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Even before a deserialized object is returned to the caller of a deserialization method a lot of code may have been executed, including static initializers, constructors, and finalizers. Automatic deserialization of fields means that an attacker may craft a nested combination of objects on which the executed initialization code may have unforeseen effects, such as the execution of arbitrary code.

    There are many different serialization frameworks. This query currently supports Kryo, XmlDecoder, XStream, SnakeYaml, JYaml, JsonIO, YAMLBeans, HessianBurlap, Castor, Burlap, Jackson, Jabsorb, Jodd JSON, Flexjson, Gson, JMS, and Java IO serialization through `ObjectInputStream`/`ObjectOutputStream`.


    ## Recommendation
    Avoid deserialization of untrusted data if at all possible. If the architecture permits it then use other formats instead of serialized objects, for example JSON or XML. However, these formats should not be deserialized into complex objects because this provides further opportunities for attack. For example, XML-based deserialization attacks are possible through libraries such as XStream and XmlDecoder.

    Alternatively, a tightly controlled whitelist can limit the vulnerability of code, but be aware of the existence of so-called Bypass Gadgets, which can circumvent such protection measures.

    Recommendations specific to particular frameworks supported by this query:

    **FastJson** - `com.alibaba:fastjson`

    * **Secure by Default**: Partially
    * **Recommendation**: Call `com.alibaba.fastjson.parser.ParserConfig#setSafeMode` with the argument `true` before deserializing untrusted data.


    **FasterXML** - `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`

    * **Secure by Default**: Yes
    * **Recommendation**: Don't call `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper#enableDefaultTyping` and don't annotate any object fields with `com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonTypeInfo` passing either the `CLASS` or `MINIMAL_CLASS` values to the annotation. Read [this guide](https://cowtowncoder.medium.com/jackson-2-10-safe-default-typing-2d018f0ce2ba).


    **Kryo** - `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` and `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5`

    * **Secure by Default**: Yes for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo5` and for `com.esotericsoftware:kryo` &gt;= v5.0.0
    * **Recommendation**: Don't call `com.esotericsoftware.kryo(5).Kryo#setRegistrationRequired` with the argument `false` on any `Kryo` instance that may deserialize untrusted data.


    **ObjectInputStream** - `Java Standard Library`

    * **Secure by Default**: No
    * **Recommendation**: Use a validating input stream, such as `org.apache.commons.io.serialization.ValidatingObjectInputStream`.


    **SnakeYAML** - `org.yaml:snakeyaml`

    * **Secure by Default**: No
    * **Recommendation**: Pass an instance of `org.yaml.snakeyaml.constructor.SafeConstructor` to `org.yaml.snakeyaml.Yaml`'s constructor before using it to deserialize untrusted data.


    **XML Decoder** - `Standard Java Library`

    * **Secure by Default**: No
    * **Recommendation**: Do not use with untrusted user input.


    **ObjectMesssage** - `Java EE/Jakarta EE`

    * **Secure by Default**: Depends on the JMS implementation.
    * **Recommendation**: Do not use with untrusted user input.



    ## Example
    The following example calls `readObject` directly on an `ObjectInputStream` that is constructed from untrusted data, and is therefore inherently unsafe.


    ```java
    public MyObject {
      public int field;
      MyObject(int field) {
        this.field = field;
      }
    }

    public MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {
      try(ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {
        return (MyObject)in.readObject(); // unsafe
      }
    }

    ```
    Rewriting the communication protocol to only rely on reading primitive types from the input stream removes the vulnerability.


    ```java
    public MyObject deserialize(Socket sock) {
      try(DataInputStream in = new DataInputStream(sock.getInputStream())) {
        return new MyObject(in.readInt());
      }
    }

    ```

    # Insecure basic authentication
    Basic authentication only obfuscates usernames and passwords in Base64 encoding, which can be easily recognized and reversed, thus it must not be transmitted over the cleartext HTTP channel. Transmitting sensitive information without using HTTPS makes the data vulnerable to packet sniffing.


    ## Recommendation
    Either use a more secure authentication mechanism like digest authentication or federated authentication, or use the HTTPS communication protocol.


    ## Example
    The following example shows two ways of using basic authentication. In the 'BAD' case, the credentials are transmitted over HTTP. In the 'GOOD' case, the credentials are transmitted over HTTPS.


    ```java
    public class InsecureBasicAuth {
      /**
       * Test basic authentication with Apache HTTP request.
       */
      public void testApacheHttpRequest(String username, String password) {

        // BAD: basic authentication over HTTP
        String url = "http://www.example.com/rest/getuser.do?uid=abcdx";

        // GOOD: basic authentication over HTTPS
        url = "https://www.example.com/rest/getuser.do?uid=abcdx";

        HttpPost post = new HttpPost(url);
        post.setHeader("Accept", "application/json");
        post.setHeader("Content-type", "application/json");

        String authString = username + ":" + password;
        byte[] authEncBytes = Base64.getEncoder().encode(authString.getBytes());
        String authStringEnc = new String(authEncBytes);

        post.addHeader("Authorization", "Basic " + authStringEnc);
      }

      /**
       * Test basic authentication with Java HTTP URL connection.
       */
      public void testHttpUrlConnection(String username, String password) {

        // BAD: basic authentication over HTTP
        String urlStr = "http://www.example.com/rest/getuser.do?uid=abcdx";

        // GOOD: basic authentication over HTTPS
        urlStr = "https://www.example.com/rest/getuser.do?uid=abcdx";

        String authString = username + ":" + password;
        String encoding = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(authString.getBytes("UTF-8"));
        URL url = new URL(urlStr);
        HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        conn.setRequestMethod("POST");
        conn.setDoOutput(true);
        conn.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Basic " + encoding);
      }
    }

    ```

    # Insecure LDAP authentication
    When using the Java LDAP API to perform LDAPv3-style extended operations and controls, a context with connection properties including user credentials is started. Transmission of LDAP credentials in cleartext allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network.


    ## Recommendation
    Use the `ldaps://` protocol to send credentials through SSL or use SASL authentication.


    ## Example
    In the following (bad) example, a `ldap://` URL is used and credentials will be sent in plaintext.


    ```java
    String ldapUrl = "ldap://ad.your-server.com:389";
    Hashtable<String, String> environment = new Hashtable<String, String>();
    environment.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory");
    environment.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, ldapUrl);
    environment.put(Context.REFERRAL, "follow");
    environment.put(Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION, "simple");
    environment.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, ldapUserName);
    environment.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, password);
    DirContext dirContext = new InitialDirContext(environment);

    ```
    In the following (good) example, a `ldaps://` URL is used so credentials will be encrypted with SSL.


    ```java
    String ldapUrl = "ldaps://ad.your-server.com:636";
    Hashtable<String, String> environment = new Hashtable<String, String>();
    environment.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory");
    environment.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, ldapUrl);
    environment.put(Context.REFERRAL, "follow");
    environment.put(Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION, "simple");
    environment.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, ldapUserName);
    environment.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, password);
    DirContext dirContext = new InitialDirContext(environment);

    ```
    In the following (good) example, a `ldap://` URL is used, but SASL authentication is enabled so that the credentials will be encrypted.


    ```java
    String ldapUrl = "ldap://ad.your-server.com:389";
    Hashtable<String, String> environment = new Hashtable<String, String>();
    environment.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory");
    environment.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, ldapUrl);
    environment.put(Context.REFERRAL, "follow");
    environment.put(Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION, "DIGEST-MD5 GSSAPI");
    environment.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, ldapUserName);
    environment.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, password);
    DirContext dirContext = new InitialDirContext(environment);

    ```

    # URL redirection from remote source
    Directly incorporating user input into a URL redirect request without validating the input can facilitate phishing attacks. In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.


    ## Recommendation
    To guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.

    If this is not possible, then the user input should be validated in some other way, for example, by verifying that the target URL is on the same host as the current page.


    ## Example
    The following example shows an HTTP request parameter being used directly in a URL redirect without validating the input, which facilitates phishing attacks:


    ```java
    public class UrlRedirect extends HttpServlet {
      protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // BAD: a request parameter is incorporated without validation into a URL redirect
        response.sendRedirect(request.getParameter("target"));
      }
    }
    ```
    One way to remedy the problem is to validate the user input against a known fixed string before doing the redirection:


    ```java
    public class UrlRedirect extends HttpServlet {
      private static final List<String> VALID_REDIRECTS = Arrays.asList(
        "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html",
        "http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html"
      );

      protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // GOOD: the request parameter is validated against a known list of strings
        String target = request.getParameter("target");
        if (VALID_REDIRECTS.contains(target)) {
            response.sendRedirect(target);
        } else {
            response.sendRedirect("/error.html");
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    Alternatively, we can check that the target URL does not redirect to a different host by checking that the URL is either relative or on a known good host:


    ```java
    public class UrlRedirect extends HttpServlet {
      protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        try {
          String urlString = request.getParameter("page");
          URI url = new URI(urlString);

          if (!url.isAbsolute()) {
            response.sendRedirect(url.toString()); // GOOD: The redirect is to a relative URL
          }

          if ("example.org".equals(url.getHost())) {
            response.sendRedirect(url.toString()); // GOOD: The redirect is to a known host
          }
        } catch (URISyntaxException e) {
            // handle exception
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    Note that as written, the above code will allow redirects to URLs on `example.com`, which is harmless but perhaps not intended. You can substitute your own domain (if known) for `example.com` to prevent this.

    # Resolving XML external entity in user-controlled data
    Parsing untrusted XML files with a weakly configured XML parser may lead to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This type of attack uses external entity references to access arbitrary files on a system, carry out denial of service, or server side request forgery. Even when the result of parsing is not returned to the user, out-of-band data retrieval techniques may allow attackers to steal sensitive data. Denial of services can also be carried out in this situation.

    There are many XML parsers for Java, and most of them are vulnerable to XXE because their default settings enable parsing of external entities. This query currently identifies vulnerable XML parsing from the following parsers: `javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder`, `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader`, `org.jdom.input.SAXBuilder`/`org.jdom2.input.SAXBuilder`, `javax.xml.parsers.SAXParser`,`org.dom4j.io.SAXReader`, `org.xml.sax.XMLReader`, `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource`, `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory`, `javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXTransformerFactory`, `javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory`, `javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller` and `javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression`.


    ## Recommendation
    The best way to prevent XXE attacks is to disable the parsing of any Document Type Declarations (DTDs) in untrusted data. If this is not possible you should disable the parsing of external general entities and external parameter entities. This improves security but the code will still be at risk of denial of service and server side request forgery attacks. Protection against denial of service attacks may also be implemented by setting entity expansion limits, which is done by default in recent JDK and JRE implementations. We recommend visiting OWASP's [XML Entity Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java), finding the specific XML parser, and applying the mitigation listed there. Other mitigations might be sufficient in some cases, but manual verification will be needed, as the query will continue to flag the parser as potentially dangerous.


    ## Example
    The following example calls `parse` on a `DocumentBuilder` that is not safely configured on untrusted data, and is therefore inherently unsafe.


    ```java
    public void parse(Socket sock) throws Exception {
      DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
      DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
      builder.parse(sock.getInputStream()); //unsafe
    }

    ```
    In this example, the `DocumentBuilder` is created with DTD disabled, securing it against XXE attack.


    ```java
    public void disableDTDParse(Socket sock) throws Exception {
      DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
      factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
      DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
      builder.parse(sock.getInputStream()); //safe
    }

    ```

    # Use of a potentially dangerous function
    This rule finds calls to methods that are dangerous to use. Currently, it checks for calls to `Thread.stop`.

    Stopping a thread with `Thread.stop` causes it to receive a `ThreadDeath` exception. That exception propagates up the stack, releasing all monitors that the thread was holding. In some cases the relevant code will be protected by catching the `ThreadDeath` exception and cleaning up, but because the exception can potentially be thrown from so very many locations, it is impractical to catch all such cases. As a result, calling `Thread.stop` is likely to result in corrupt data.


    ## Recommendation
    The best solution is usually to provide an alternate communication mechanism for the thread that might need to be interrupted early. For example, Oracle gives the following example of using a volatile variable to communicate whether the worker thread should exit:


    ```java
    private volatile Thread blinker;

    public void stop() {
        blinker = null;
    }

    public void run() {
        Thread thisThread = Thread.currentThread();
        while (blinker == thisThread) {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(interval);
            } catch (InterruptedException e){
            }
            repaint();
        }
    }

    ```
    It is also possible to use `Thread.interrupt` and to catch and handle `InterruptedException` when it occurs. However, it can be difficult to handle an `InterruptedException` everywhere it might occur; for example, the sample code above simply discards the exception rather than actually exiting the thread.

    Another strategy is to use message passing, for example via a `BlockingQueue`. In addition to passing the worker thread its ordinary work via such a message queue, the worker can be asked to exit by a particular kind of message being sent on the queue.

  queryHelp: "# Polynomial regular expression used on uncontrolled data\nSome regular\
    \ expressions take a long time to match certain input strings to the point where\
    \ the time it takes to match a string of length *n* is proportional to *n<sup>k</sup>*\
    \ or even *2<sup>n</sup>*. Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance,\
    \ or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack\
    \ by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\
    \nThe regular expression engine provided by Java uses a backtracking non-deterministic\
    \ finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach\
    \ is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups,\
    \ it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such\
    \ an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings\
    \ of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the\
    \ automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected\
    \ by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the\
    \ sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in\
    \ multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found\
    \ in the references.\n\nNote that Java versions 9 and above have some mitigations\
    \ against ReDoS; however they aren't perfect and more complex regular expressions\
    \ can still be affected by this problem.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular\
    \ expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with\
    \ the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter.\
    \ Alternatively, an alternate regex library that guarantees linear time execution,\
    \ such as Google's RE2J, may be used.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a\
    \ regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\
    \n```java\n\nPattern.compile(\"^\\\\s+|\\\\s+$\").matcher(text).replaceAll(\"\"\
    ) // BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters\
    \ in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace\
    \ sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace\
    \ character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process\
    \ each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\n\
    This ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in\
    \ the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds\
    \ to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will\
    \ take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression\
    \ to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences.\
    \ For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`\"^\\\\s+|(?<!\\\\s)\\\\s+$\"\
    `), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the\
    \ sub-expression `\"^\\\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts\
    \ when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine\
    \ matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler\
    \ problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly\
    \ written using scientific notation:\n\n```java\n\n\"^0\\\\.\\\\d+E?\\\\d+$\"\"\
    \ \n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\\
    d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the\
    \ first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\n\
    This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string\
    \ will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once\
    \ per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\n\
    To make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such\
    \ that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `\"^0\\\
    \\.\\\\d+(E\\\\d+)?$\"`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular\
    \ expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices\
    \ to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular\
    \ expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have\
    \ quadratic time complexity:\n\n```java\n\nPattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\\
    d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\", str); \n```\nIt is not immediately\
    \ obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem. However,\
    \ you can mitigate performance issues by limiting the length to 1000 characters,\
    \ which will always finish in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n```java\n\nif (str.length()\
    \ > 1000) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Input too long\");\n}\n\n\
    Pattern.matches(\"^(\\\\+|-)?(\\\\d+|(\\\\d*\\\\.\\\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\\\d+)?$\"\
    , str); \n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service\

    # Inefficient regular expression
    Some regular expressions take a long time to match certain input strings to the point where the time it takes to match a string of length *n* is proportional to *n<sup>k</sup>* or even *2<sup>n</sup>*. Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service ("DoS") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.

More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.

    Note that Java versions 9 and above have some mitigations against ReDoS; however they aren't perfect and more complex regular expressions can still be affected by this problem.


    ## Recommendation
    Modify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter. Alternatively, an alternate regex library that guarantees linear time execution, such as Google's RE2J, may be used.


    ## Example
    Consider this regular expression:

    ```java

    ^_(__|.)+_$
    ```
    Its sub-expression `"(__|.)+?"` can match the string `"__"` either by the first alternative `"__"` to the left of the `"|"` operator, or by two repetitions of the second alternative `"."` to the right. Thus, a string consisting of an odd number of underscores followed by some other character will cause the regular expression engine to run for an exponential amount of time before rejecting the input.

    This problem can be avoided by rewriting the regular expression to remove the ambiguity between the two branches of the alternative inside the repetition:

    ```java

    ^_(__|[^_])+_$
    ```

    # Regular expression injection
    Constructing a regular expression with unsanitized user input is dangerous as a malicious user may be able to modify the meaning of the expression. In particular, such a user may be able to provide a regular expression fragment that takes exponential time in the worst case, and use that to perform a Denial of Service attack.


    ## Recommendation
    Before embedding user input into a regular expression, use a sanitization function such as `Pattern.quote` to escape meta-characters that have special meaning.


    ## Example
    The following example shows an HTTP request parameter that is used to construct a regular expression.

    In the first case the user-provided regex is not escaped. If a malicious user provides a regex whose worst-case performance is exponential, then this could lead to a Denial of Service.

    In the second case, the user input is escaped using `Pattern.quote` before being included in the regular expression. This ensures that the user cannot insert characters which have a special meaning in regular expressions.


    ```java
    import java.util.regex.Pattern;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
    import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

    public class RegexInjectionDemo extends HttpServlet {

      public boolean badExample(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request) {
        String regex = request.getParameter("regex");
        String input = request.getParameter("input");

        // BAD: Unsanitized user input is used to construct a regular expression
        return input.matches(regex);
      }

      public boolean goodExample(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request) {
        String regex = request.getParameter("regex");
        String input = request.getParameter("input");

        // GOOD: User input is sanitized before constructing the regex
        return input.matches(Pattern.quote(regex));
      }
    }

    ```

    # Reading from a world writable file
    Reading from a world-writable file is dangerous on a multi-user system because other users may be able to affect program execution by modifying or deleting the file.


    ## Recommendation
    Do not make files explicitly world writable unless the file is intended to be written by multiple users on a multi-user system. In many cases, the file may only need to be writable for the current user.

    For some file systems, there may be alternatives to setting the file to be world writable. For example, POSIX file systems support "groups" which may be used to ensure that only subset of all the users can write to the file. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are available for many operating system and file system combinations, and can provide fine-grained read and write support without resorting to world writable permissions.


    ## Example
    In the following example, we are loading some configuration parameters from a file:

    ```java

    private void readConfig(File configFile) {
      if (!configFile.exists()) {
        // Create an empty config file
        configFile.createNewFile();
        // Make the file writable for all
        configFile.setWritable(true, false);
      }
      // Now read the config
      loadConfig(configFile);
    }

    ```
    If the configuration file does not yet exist, an empty file is created. Creating an empty file can simplify the later code and is a convenience for the user. However, by setting the file to be world writable, we allow any user on the system to modify the configuration, not just the current user. If there may be untrusted users on the system, this is potentially dangerous.

    # Use of RSA algorithm without OAEP
    Cryptographic algorithms often use padding schemes to make the plaintext less predictable. The OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding) scheme should be used with RSA encryption. Using an outdated padding scheme such as PKCS1, or no padding at all, can weaken the encryption by making it vulnerable to a padding oracle attack.


    ## Recommendation
    Use the OAEP scheme when using RSA encryption.


    ## Example
    In the following example, the BAD case shows no padding being used, whereas the GOOD case shows an OAEP scheme being used.


    ```java
    // BAD: No padding scheme is used
    Cipher rsa = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/NoPadding");
    ...

    //GOOD: OAEP padding is used
    Cipher rsa = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-1AndMGF1Padding");
    ...
    ```

    # Hard-coded credential in API call
    Including unencrypted hard-coded authentication credentials in source code is dangerous because the credentials may be easily discovered. For example, the code may be open source, or it may be leaked or accidentally revealed, making the credentials visible to an attacker. This, in turn, might enable them to gain unauthorized access, or to obtain privileged information.


    ## Recommendation
    Remove hard-coded credentials, such as user names, passwords and certificates, from source code. Instead, place them in configuration files, environment variables or other data stores if necessary. If possible, store configuration files including credential data separately from the source code, in a secure location with restricted access.


    ## Example
    The following code example connects to a database using a hard-coded user name and password:


    ```java
    private static final String p = "123456"; // hard-coded credential

    public static void main(String[] args) throws SQLException {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test";
        String u = "admin"; // hard-coded credential

        getConn(url, u, p);
    }

    public static void getConn(String url, String v, String q) throws SQLException {
        DriverManager.getConnection(url, v, q); // sensitive call
    }

    ```
    Instead, the user name and password could be supplied through environment variables, which can be set externally without hard-coding credentials in the source code.

    \ code statements to be executed conditionally, for example `if` statements and\
    \ `for` statements. If these statements contain important authentication or login\
    \ code, and the decision about whether to execute this code is based on user-controlled\
    \ data, it may be possible for an attacker to bypass security systems by preventing\

    \ a user based on data that may be controlled by that user. If necessary, ensure\
    \ that the data is validated extensively when it is input before any authentication\

    \ personalization settings can be applied without authentication because this\
    \ is not sensitive information. However, users should be allowed to take sensitive\
    \ actions only when they have been fully authenticated.\n\n\n## Example\nThis\
    \ example shows two ways of deciding whether to authenticate a user. The first\
    \ way shows a decision that is based on the value of a cookie. Cookies can be\

    \ that is based on looking up the user in a security database.\n\n\n```java\n\
    public boolean doLogin(String user, String password) {\n\tCookie adminCookie =\
    \ getCookies()[0];\n\n\t// BAD: login is executed only if the value of 'adminCookie'\
    \ is 'false', \n\t// but 'adminCookie' is controlled by the user\n\tif(adminCookie.getValue()==\"\

    \ doLogin(String user, String password) {\n\tCookie adminCookie = getCookies()[0];\n\
    \t\n\t// GOOD: use server-side information based on the credentials to decide\n\

    \ two ways to specify the permissions to check. The first way uses a string, `whatDoTheyWantToDo`,\
    \ to specify the permissions to check. However, this string is built from user\

    \ example, while trying to access the account details of another user, the attacker\
    \ could force the system to check whether they had permissions to access their\
    \ *own* account details, which is incorrect, and would allow them to perform the\
    \ action. The second, more secure way uses a fixed check that does not depend\
    \ on data that is controlled by the user.\n\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[]\
    \ args) {\n\tString whatDoTheyWantToDo = args[0];\n\tSubject subject = SecurityUtils.getSubject();\n\
    \n\t// BAD: permissions decision made using tainted data\n\tif(subject.isPermitted(\"\

    # Failure to use HTTPS or SFTP URL in Maven artifact upload/download
    Using an insecure protocol like HTTP or FTP to download your dependencies leaves your Maven build vulnerable to a [Man in the Middle (MITM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). This can allow attackers to inject malicious code into the artifacts that you are resolving and infect build artifacts that are being produced. This can be used by attackers to perform a [Supply chain attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack) against your project's users.

    This vulnerability has a [ CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.1/10 ](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1).


    ## Recommendation
    Always use HTTPS or SFTP to download artifacts from artifact servers.


    ## Example
    These examples show examples of locations in Maven POM files where artifact repository upload/download is configured. The first shows the use of HTTP, the second shows the use of HTTPS.

    \ locks using `tryLock()` instead of `lock()`.\n\n## Example\nIn the following\
    \ example, one method acquires `primaryLock` followed by `savingsLock`, and another\
    \ method acquires these locks in reverse order. This may result in deadlock if\
    \ the two methods are invoked by two threads simultaneously, and each thread acquires\
    \ one of the two locks prior to being able to acquire the other one.\n\n\n```java\n\
    class Test {\n\tprivate int primaryAccountBalance;\n\tprivate Object primaryLock\

    \ = new Object();\n\n\tpublic boolean transferToSavings(int amount) {\n\t\tsynchronized(primaryLock)\
    \ {\n\t\t\tsynchronized(savingsLock) {\n\t\t\t\tif (amount>0 && primaryAccountBalance>=amount)\

    \t}\n\tpublic boolean transferToPrimary(int amount) {\n\t\t// AVOID: lock order\
    \ is different from \"transferToSavings\"\n\t\t// and may result in deadlock\n\
    \t\tsynchronized(savingsLock) {\n\t\t\tsynchronized(primaryLock) {\n\t\t\t\tif\
    \ (amount>0 && savingsAccountBalance>=amount) {\n\t\t\t\t\tsavingsAccountBalance\
    \ -= amount;\n\t\t\t\t\tprimaryAccountBalance += amount;\n\t\t\t\t\treturn true;\n\
    \t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t\treturn false;\n\t}\n}\n\n```\nOne way to address\
    \ the issue in the above example is to reverse the lock order in `transferToPrimary`\
    \ to match the lock order in `transferToSecondary`.\n\n\n## References\n* SEI\

    # Loop with unreachable exit condition
    Loops can contain multiple exit conditions, either directly in the loop condition or as guards around `break` or `return` statements. If an exit condition cannot be satisfied, then the code is misleading at best, and the loop might not terminate.


    ## Recommendation
    When writing a loop that is intended to terminate, make sure that all the necessary exit conditions can be satisfied and that loop termination is clear.


    ## Example
    The following example shows a potentially infinite loop, since the inner loop condition is constantly true. Of course, the loop may or may not be infinite depending on the behavior of `shouldBreak`, but if this was intended as the only exit condition the loop should be rewritten to make this clear.


    ```java
    for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
        for (int j=0; i<10; j++) {
            // do stuff
            if (shouldBreak()) break;
        }
    }

    ```
    To fix the loop the condition is corrected to check the right variable.


    ```java
    for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
        for (int j=0; j<10; j++) {
            // do stuff
            if (shouldBreak()) break;
        }
    }

    ```

    # Improper verification of intent by broadcast receiver
    When an Android application uses a `BroadcastReceiver` to receive intents, it is also able to receive explicit intents that are sent directly to it, regardless of its filter. Certain intent actions are only able to be sent by the operating system, not third-party applications. However, a `BroadcastReceiver` that is registered to receive system intents is still able to receive intents from a third-party application, so it should check that the intent received has the expected action. Otherwise, a third-party application could impersonate the system this way to cause unintended behavior, such as a denial of service.


    ## Example
    In the following code, the `ShutdownReceiver` initiates a shutdown procedure upon receiving an intent, without checking that the received action is indeed `ACTION_SHUTDOWN`. This allows third-party applications to send explicit intents to this receiver to cause a denial of service.


    ```java
    public class ShutdownReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
        @Override
        public void onReceive(final Context context, final Intent intent) {
            mainActivity.saveLocalData();
            mainActivity.stopActivity();
        }
    }
    ```

    ```xml
    <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" package="test">
        <application>
            <receiver android:name=".BootReceiverXml">
                <intent-filter>
                    <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />
                </intent-filter>
            </receiver>
        </application>
    </manifest>
    ```

    ## Recommendation
    In the `onReceive` method of a `BroadcastReceiver`, the action of the received Intent should be checked. The following code demonstrates this.


    ```java
    public class ShutdownReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
        @Override
        public void onReceive(final Context context, final Intent intent) {
            if (!intent.getAction().equals(Intent.ACTION_SHUTDOWN)) {
                return;
            }
            mainActivity.saveLocalData();
            mainActivity.stopActivity();
        }
    }
    ```

    # Missing read or write permission in a content provider
    The Android manifest file specifies the content providers for the application using `provider` elements. The `provider` element specifies the explicit permissions an application requires in order to access a resource using that provider. You specify the permissions using the `android:readPermission`, `android:writePermission`, or `android:permission` attributes. If you do not specify the permission required to perform an operation, the application will implicitly have access to perform that operation. For example, if you specify only `android:readPermission`, the application must have explicit permission to read data, but requires no permission to write data.


    ## Recommendation
    To prevent permission bypass, you should create `provider` elements that either specify both the `android:readPermission` and `android:writePermission` attributes, or specify the `android:permission` attribute.


    ## Example
    In the following two (bad) examples, the provider is configured with only read or write permissions. This allows a malicious application to bypass the permission check by requesting access to the unrestricted operation.


    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <application ...>
          <!-- BAD: only 'android:readPermission' is set -->
          <provider
              android:name=".MyContentProvider"
              android:authorities="table"
              android:enabled="true"
              android:exported="true"
              android:readPermission="android.permission.MANAGE_DOCUMENTS">
          </provider>
        </application>
    </manifest>

    ```

    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <application ...>
          <!-- BAD: only 'android:writePermission' is set -->
          <provider
              android:name=".MyContentProvider"
              android:authorities="table"
              android:enabled="true"
              android:exported="true"
              android:writePermission="android.permission.MANAGE_DOCUMENTS">
          </provider>
        </application>
    </manifest>

    ```
    In the following (good) examples, the provider is configured with full permissions, protecting it from a permissions bypass.


    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <application ...>
          <!-- Good: both 'android:readPermission' and 'android:writePermission' are set -->
          <provider
              android:name=".MyContentProvider"
              android:authorities="table"
              android:enabled="true"
              android:exported="true"
              android:writePermission="android.permission.MANAGE_DOCUMENTS"
              android:readPermission="android.permission.MANAGE_DOCUMENTS">
          </provider>
        </application>
    </manifest>

    ```

    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <application ...>
          <!-- Good: 'android:permission' is set  -->
          <provider

              android:authorities="table"
              android:enabled="true"
              android:exported="true"
              android:permission="android.permission.MANAGE_DOCUMENTS">
          </provider>
        </application>

    # Implicitly exported Android component
    The Android manifest file defines configuration settings for Android applications. In this file, components can be declared with intent filters which specify what the components can do and what types of intents the components can respond to. If the `android:exported` attribute is omitted from the component when an intent filter is included, then the component will be implicitly exported.

    An implicitly exported component could allow for improper access to the component and its data.


    ## Recommendation
    Explicitly set the `android:exported` attribute for every component or use permissions to limit access to the component.


    ## Example
    In the example below, the `android:exported` attribute is omitted when an intent filter is used.


    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <application ...
            <!-- BAD: this component is implicitly exported -->
            <activity>
                android:name=".Activity">
                <intent-filter>
                    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
                </intent-filter>
            </activity>
        </application>
    </manifest>

    ```
    A corrected version sets the `android:exported` attribute to `false`.


    ```xml
    <manifest ... >
        <application ...
            <!-- GOOD: this component is not exported due to 'android:exported' explicitly set to 'false'-->
            <activity>
                android:name=".Activity">
                android:exported="false"
                <intent-filter>

                </intent-filter>
            </activity>
        </application>

    \ the `Intent` is executed, it behaves as if it were run directly by the supplying\
    \ application, using the privileges of that application.\n\nIf a `PendingIntent`\
    \ is configured to be mutable, the fields of its internal `Intent` can be changed\
    \ by the receiving application if they were not previously set. This means that\
    \ a mutable `PendingIntent` that has not defined a destination component (that\
    \ is, an implicit `PendingIntent`) can be altered to execute an arbitrary action\
    \ with the privileges of the application that created it.\n\nA malicious application\
    \ can access an implicit `PendingIntent` as follows:\n\n* It is wrapped and sent\
    \ as an extra of another implicit `Intent`.\n* It is sent as the action of a `Slide`.\n\
    * It is sent as the action of a `Notification`.\n\n\nOn gaining access, the attacker\
    \ can modify the underlying `Intent` and execute an arbitrary action with elevated\
    \ privileges. This could give the malicious application access to private components\
    \ of the victim application, or the ability to perform actions without having\
    \ the necessary permissions.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nAvoid creating implicit `PendingIntent`s.\
    \ This means that the underlying `Intent` should always have an explicit destination\
    \ component.\n\nWhen you add the `PendingIntent` as an extra of another `Intent`,\
    \ make sure that this second `Intent` also has an explicit destination component,\
    \ so that it is not delivered to untrusted applications.\n\nCreate the `PendingIntent`\
    \ using the flag `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` whenever possible, to prevent the destination\
    \ component from modifying empty fields of the underlying `Intent`.\n\n\n## Example\n\
    In the following examples, a `PendingIntent` is created and wrapped as an extra\
    \ of another `Intent`.\n\nIn the first example, both the `PendingIntent` and the\
    \ `Intent` it is wrapped in are implicit, making them vulnerable to attack.\n\n\
    In the second example, the issue is avoided by adding explicit destination components\
    \ to the `PendingIntent` and the wrapping `Intent`.\n\nThe third example uses\
    \ the `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` flag to prevent the underlying `Intent` from being modified\
    \ by the destination component.\n\n\n```java\nimport android.app.Activity;\nimport\
    \ android.app.PendingIntent;\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport android.os.Bundle;\n\
    \npublic class ImplicitPendingIntents extends Activity {\n\n\tpublic void onCreate(Bundle\
    \ savedInstance) {\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// BAD: an implicit Intent is used to create\
    \ a PendingIntent.\n\t\t\t// The PendingIntent is then added to another implicit\
    \ Intent\n\t\t\t// and started.\n\t\t\tIntent baseIntent = new Intent();\n\t\t\
    \tPendingIntent pi =\n\t\t\t\t\tPendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, baseIntent,\

    \t\t}\n\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// GOOD: both the PendingIntent and the wrapping Intent\
    \ are explicit.\n\t\t\tIntent safeIntent = new Intent(this, AnotherActivity.class);\n\
    \t\t\tPendingIntent pi =\n\t\t\t\t\tPendingIntent.getActivity(this, 0, safeIntent,\

  queryHelp: "# Leaking sensitive information through an implicit Intent\nWhen an\
    \ implicit Intent is used with a method such as `startActivity`, `startService`,\
    \ or `sendBroadcast`, it may be read by other applications on the device.\n\n\
    This means that sensitive data in these Intents may be leaked.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\
    For `sendBroadcast` methods, a receiver permission may be specified so that only\
    \ applications with a certain permission may receive the Intent; or a `LocalBroadcastManager`\
    \ may be used. Otherwise, ensure that Intents containing sensitive data have an\
    \ explicit receiver class set.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows two\
    \ ways of broadcasting Intents. In the 'BAD' case, no \"receiver permission\"\
    \ is specified. In the 'GOOD' case, \"receiver permission\" or \"receiver application\"\
    \ is specified.\n\n\n```java\npublic void sendBroadcast1(Context context, String\
    \ token, String refreshToken) \n{\n    {\n        // BAD: broadcast sensitive\
    \ information to all listeners\n        Intent intent = new Intent();\n      \
    \  intent.setAction(\"com.example.custom_action\");\n        intent.putExtra(\"\
    token\", token);\n        intent.putExtra(\"refreshToken\", refreshToken);\n \
    \       context.sendBroadcast(intent);\n    }\n\n    {\n        // GOOD: broadcast\
    \ sensitive information only to those with permission\n        Intent intent =\
    \ new Intent();\n        intent.setAction(\"com.example.custom_action\");\n  \
    \      intent.putExtra(\"token\", token);\n        intent.putExtra(\"refreshToken\"\
    , refreshToken);\n        context.sendBroadcast(intent, \"com.example.user_permission\"\
    );\n    }\n\n    {\n        // GOOD: broadcast sensitive information to a specific\
    \ application\n        Intent intent = new Intent();\n        intent.setAction(\"\
    com.example.custom_action\");\n        intent.setClassName(\"com.example2\", \"\
    com.example2.UserInfoHandler\");\n        intent.putExtra(\"token\", token);\n\
